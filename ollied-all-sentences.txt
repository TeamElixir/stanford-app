In 2008, federal officials received a tip from a confidential informant that Lee had sold the informant ecstasy and marijuana.

After obtaining a warrant, the officials searched Lee's house, where they found drugs, cash, and a loaded rifle.
0.818: (they; found; drugs)
0.756: (the officials; searched; Lee 's house)

Lee admitted that the drugs were his, and a grand jury indicted him on one count of possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute.
0.957: (his , and a grand jury; indicted him on; one count possessing ecstasy with intent)[attrib=Lee admitted]
0.835: (his , and a grand jury; indicted; him)[attrib=Lee admitted]

0.92: (Lee; entered into; plea discussions)

Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.
0.883: (Lee; was sentenced to; a year and a day)
0.821: (Lee; accepted; a plea)

Lee had in fact pleaded guilty to an "aggravated felony" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. ยง1101(a)(43)(B), so he was, contrary to his attorney's advice, subject to mandatory deportation as a result of that plea.

0.92: (Lee; learned of; this consequence)
0.776: (his attorney; had provided; ineffective assistance)
0.761: (he; filed; a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence)

At an evidentiary hearing, both Lee and his plea-stage counsel testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee in deciding whether to accept a plea, and Lee's counsel acknowledged that although Lee's defense to the charge was weak, if he had known Lee would be deported upon pleading guilty, he would have advised him to go to trial.

The District Court, however, denied relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
0.691: (The District Court; however denied; relief)
0.507: (the Sixth Circuit; however denied; relief)

Applying the two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee could not show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.
0.75: (he; was prejudiced by; his attorney 's erroneous advice)[attrib=Lee could not show]

Held: Lee has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel's erroneous advice.
0.76: (he; was prejudiced by; his counsel 's erroneous advice)

(a) When a defendant claims that his counsel's deficient performance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."

Lee contends that he can make this showing because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation.
0.693: (the result; would be; deportation)
0.535: (he; can make; this showing)[enabler=because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation;attrib=Lee contends]

The Government contends that Lee cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to acquittal.
0.671: (Lee; cannot show; prejudice)[attrib=The Government contends]

Pp. 5-8.

(b) The Government makes two errors in urging the adoption of a per se rule that a defendant with no viable defense cannot show prejudice from the denial of his right to trial.
0.788: (The Government; makes; two errors)
0.712: (a defendant; cannot show; prejudice)
0.638: (b; makes; two errors)

First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that demands a "case-by-case examination" of the "totality of the evidence."

0.497: (466 U. S.; be Strickland at; 695)

More fundamentally, it overlooks that the Hill v. Lockhart inquiry focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.
0.893: (Lockhart inquiry; focuses on; a defendant 's decisionmaking which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial)
0.839: (the Hill; focuses on; a defendant 's decisionmaking which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial)

The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.
0.743: (the respective consequences of a conviction; be assessing after; trial and by plea)
0.743: (the respective consequences of a conviction; be assessing by; trial and by plea)

When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.

For Lee, deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time; he says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation in favor of throwing a "Hail Mary" at trial.
0.785: (he; accordingly would have rejected; any plea leading to deportation in favor)[attrib=he says]
0.716: (any plea; leading in; favor throwing a " Hail Mary " at trial)
0.701: (any plea; leading to; deportation)

That statement, however, was made in the context of discussing the presumption of reliability applied to judicial proceedings, which has no place where, as here, a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether.

0.606: (no place where , as here , a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether; be has by; judicial proceedings)

When the inquiry is focused on what an individual defendant would have done, the possibility of even a highly improbable result may be pertinent to the extent it would have affected the defendant's decisionmaking.

(c) Courts should not upset a plea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.

0.721: (a plea; should be not upset solely because of; post hoc assertions)

Rather, they should look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences.
0.898: (they; Rather should look to; contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant 's expressed preferences)

In the unusual circumstances of this case, Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation: Both Lee and his attorney testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee; his responses during his plea colloquy confirmed the importance he placed on deportation; and he had strong connections to the United States, while he had no ties to South Korea.

0.3: (Lee and his attorney; be his responses during; his plea colloquy)
0.157: (he; be his responses during; his plea colloquy)

The Government argues that Lee cannot "convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances," Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. 356, 372, since deportation would almost certainly result from a trial.
0.784: (deportation; would almost certainly result from; a trial)

0.719: (Padilla; 559; U. S. 356)[enabler=since deportation would almost certainly result from a trial]
0.581: (Lee; cannot convince; the court)

Unlike the Government, this Court cannot say that it would be irrational for someone in Lee's position to risk additional prison time in exchange for holding on to some chance of avoiding deportation.
0.679: (additional prison time; to be risk in; exchange)
0.678: (it; would be irrational for; someone)[attrib=this Court cannot say]

As a general matter, it makes sense that a defendant who has no realistic defense to a charge supported by sufficient evidence will be unable to carry his burden of showing prejudice from accepting a guilty plea.

But in elevating this general proposition to a per se rule, the Government makes two errors.
0.761: (the Government; makes; two errors)

First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that we have emphasized demands a "case-by-case examination" of the "totality of the evidence."

And, more fundamentally, the Government overlooks that the inquiry we prescribed in Hill v. Lockhart focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.

A defendant without any viable defense will be highly likely to lose at trial.
0.788: (A defendant; will be highly; likely)

And a defendant facing such long odds will rarely be able to show prejudice from accepting a guilty plea that offers him a better resolution than would be likely after trial.
0.724: (such long odds; will rarely be; able)
0.723: (such long odds; to show; prejudice)

But that is not because the prejudice inquiry in this context looks to the probability of a conviction for its own sake.

It is instead because defendants obviously weigh their prospects at trial in deciding whether to accept a plea.

In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.
0.678: (the defendant; to go to; trial)

It focused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more favorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at the suppression hearing.

The Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant "would have accepted the earlier plea offer," it is also "necessary" to show a "reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time."

As we have explained, assessing the effect of some types of attorney errors on defendants' decisionmaking involves such predictions: Where an attorney error allegedly affects how a trial would have played out, we analyze that error's effects on a defendant's decisionmaking by making a prediction of the likely trial outcome.

Neither Panetti nor Ford "clearly established" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.

Nor was the state court's decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it.
0.932: (the state court 's decision; founded on; an unreasonable assessment of the evidence)

Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.

As we understand it, his argument depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one "judgment," as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it "springs forward" under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.

As this Court explained in construing Rule 4(a)(2)'s parallel provision for civil cases, the Rule "was intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment."

By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been "announce[d]" and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.

The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, Part II-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.

As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order.

I join Justice Alito's opinion in full but write separately regarding the accrual date for a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim.
0.704: (I; join; Justice Alito 's opinion)

Justice Alito suggests that a claim for unreasonable seizure based on a warrantless arrest might not accrue until the "first appearance" under Illinois law (or the "initial appearance" under federal law)--which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest--rather than at the time of the arrest.
0.678: (the " first appearance; represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for; that kind of arrest--rather)
0.587: (unreasonable seizure; be based on; a warrantless arrest)
0.564: (the " first appearance; represents; the first judicial determination of probable cause)

See post, at 1, 9 (dissenting opinion); see also Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384 (2007) (taking a similar approach).
No extractions found.

Which of those events is the correct one for purposes of accrual makes no difference in this case, because both the arrest and the first appearance occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit.
0.864: (the arrest and the first appearance; occurred; than two years)
0.798: (the correct one; makes; no difference)[enabler=because both the arrest and the first appearance occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit]
0.722: (petitioner; filed; suit)

See ante, at 4; see also Wallace, supra, at 387 (petitioner's claim was untimely regardless of whether it accrued on day of arrest or first appearance).
0.834: (ante; be See at; 4)
0.716: (it; accrued on; day of arrest or first appearance)
0.513: (supra; be Wallace at; 387)

I would leave for another case (one where the question is dispositive) whether an unreasonable-seizure claim would accrue on the date of the first appearance if that appearance occurred on some day after the arrest.
0.836: (an unreasonable-seizure claim; would accrue on; the date of the first appearance)[enabler=if that appearance occurred on some day after the arrest]
0.724: (I; would leave for; another case)
0.585: (the question; is; dispositive)
0.286: (that appearance; occurred on; some day)
0.211: (that appearance; occurred after; the arrest)

I think the answer to that question might turn on the meaning of "seizure," rather than on the presence or absence of any form of legal process.
0.779: (the answer; might turn on; the meaning of ")[attrib=I think]

See post, at 7-8 (describing the ordinary meaning of "seizure").

I agree with the Court's holding up to a point: The protection provided by the Fourth Amendment continues to apply after "the start of legal process," ante, at 1, if legal process is understood to mean the issuance of an arrest warrant or what is called a "first appearance" under Illinois law and an "initial appearance" under federal law.

But if the Court means more--specifically, that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as pretrial detention lasts--the Court stretches the concept of a seizure much too far.

What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court's approach is that it entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide, i.e., whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.

The question that was set out in Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari and that we agreed to decide is as follows:
0.506: (we; was set out in; Manuel 's petition)

"[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment.

0.595: (unreasonable seizure; continues so beyond; legal process)[enabler=as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment]

Since then, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D. C. Circuits have all held that a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim is cognizable through 42 U. S. C. ยง1983 ("Section 1983").

0.921: (Manuel; is released from; jail)

April 22, 2013: Manuel files his complaint.
0.741: (Manuel; files; his complaint)

Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel's claim is untimely unless it accrued on or after April 22, 2011.

And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.

Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question--the one that the Court actually agreed to review--is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on the Fourth Amendment.

To make out a claim for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff generally must show three things: (1) "that the criminal proceeding was initiated or continued by the defendant without 'probable cause,' " W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, P. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 876 (5th ed.

The Court purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

That proposition--that every moment in pretrial detention constitutes a "seizure"--is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.

It is not generally used to refer to a prolonged detention.

The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as "detention" or "confinement," if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.

0.626: (the Amendment; to see; a more expansive term)
0.165: (a Fourth Amendment seizure; could be; a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period)

In my view, a period of detention spanning weeks or months cannot be viewed as one long, continuing seizure, and a pretrial detainee is not "seized" over and over again as long as he remains in custody.3 Of course, the damages resulting from an unlawful seizure may continue to mount during the period of confinement caused by the seizure, but no new Fourth Amendment seizure claims accrue after that date.4 Thus, any possible Fourth Amendment claim that Manuel could bring is time barred.

The Court reads Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266 (1994), and Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), to mean that the Fourth Amendment can be violated "when legal process itself goes wrong," ante, at 9, but the accuracy of that interpretation depends on the meaning of "legal process."

According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking, id., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under 42 U. S. C. ยง1983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.

0.771: (Oliver; had violated; his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause)
0.43: (Albright; be id at; 345)

All that this Court held was that Albright's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.
No extractions found.

The Court now reads Albright to mean that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues "after the start of 'legal process," but three forms of what might be termed "legal process" were issued in Albright: the arrest warrant, the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance, and the order holding him over for trial after the preliminary examination.
0.689: (a Fourth Amendment seizure; continues after; the start of 'legal process)[attrib=Albright to mean]
0.676: (three forms what might be termed "legal process "; were issued; the arrest warrant , the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance , and the order holding)

0.46: (three forms what might be termed "legal process "; were issued the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance in; Albright)

I agree that Albright's seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant (that would be ridiculous since he had not even been arrested at that point) or the first appearance, see ante, at 8-9, and n. 6, but it is impossible to read anything more into the holding in Albright.
0.755: (Albright 's seizure; did not end with; the issuance of the warrant)
0.619: (it; is; impossible)
0.575: (he; had not even been arrested at; that point ) or the first appearance)

The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined the plurality opinion, referred only to Albright's "arrest," 510 U. S., at 275 (concurring opinion); and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in the judgment, did so only because Albright's "allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment."

To read anything more into Albright is to adopt the position taken by just one Member of the plurality, see id., at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (seizure continues throughout the period of pretrial detention), and the two Justices in dissent, see id., at 307 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same).

The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.

For example, the Court cites Gerstein's statement that "[t]he Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system," and that it "always has been thought to define the 'process that is due' for seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial."

This statement hardly shows that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein--which suggests that the Fourth Amendment might govern "only the first stage" of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our "elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct."

Nothing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment: Whatever its precise form, if the proceeding is tainted--as here, by fabricated evidence--and the result is that probable cause is lacking, then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.

Argued: December 6, 2017    Decided: March 21, 2018
No extractions found.

Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermittently investigated petitioner Marinello's tax activities.
No extractions found.

In 2012, the Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal tax statutes, a provision in 26 U. S. C. ยง7212(a) known as the Omnibus Clause, which forbids "corruptly or by force or threats of force . . . obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code]."
0.807: (the Government; indicted; Marinello)
0.695: (the Government; indicted Marinello in; 2012)
0.589: (Marinello; be indicted in; 2012)

The judge instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause violation, it must find that he "corruptly" engaged in at least one of eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.

0.494: (Marinello; knew; he)

Marinello was convicted.

The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular investigation.
0.894: (the defendant; tried to interfere with; a pending IRS proceeding)
0.82: (the defendant; to interfere with; a pending IRS proceeding)

(a) In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, this Court interpreted a similarly worded criminal statute--which made it a felony "corruptly or by threats or force . . .

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has "traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of concern that 'a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.'

Subsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual identifiable persons or property.
0.705: (corrupt or forceful actions; be taken against; individual identifiable persons or property)

In context, the Omnibus Clause logically serves as a "catchall" for the obstructive conduct the subsection sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine administrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds.
0.805: (the Omnibus Clause; logically serves as; a " catchall)

Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge instructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the Omnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he engaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned, that the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he did so "corruptly," meaning "with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself ] or for another."

That is because the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, ranging from willful failure to furnish a required statement to employees, ยง7204, to failure to keep required records, ยง7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to which an employee is entitled on IRS Form W-4, ยง7205, to failure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount, ยง7203.

Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of Thomas, J.), Marinello's preferred reading of ยง7212 potentially overlaps with another provision of federal law that criminalizes the obstruction of the "due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States," 18 U.

The words "this title" cannot be read to mean "only some of this title."
No extractions found.

As this Court recently reiterated, phrases such as "this title" most naturally refer to the cited provision "as a whole."

0.739: (this title; most naturally refer as; a whole)

Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8).
No extractions found.

Congress used "this title" throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its entirety.
0.835: (Congress; used " in; this title to refer to the Tax Code in its entirety)

See, e.g., ยง7201 ("[a]ny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title"); ยง7203 ("[a]ny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title . . . to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to [do so]").
0.793: (any tax; be imposed by; this title)

NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U.

0.793: (a statement; be "required under; section 6051")
0.793: (documents; be "required under; section 6420(e )( 2)
0.745: (criminalizing; willfully failing to furnish; a statement "required under section 6051")

Thus, "this title" must refer to the Tax Code as a whole.
0.812: (this title; Thus must refer to; the Tax Code)
0.797: (this title; Thus must refer as; a whole)

The phrase "due administration of this title" likewise refers to the due administration of the entire Tax Code.
0.885: (The phrase "due administration of this title; likewise refers to; the due administration of the entire Tax Code)

As this Court has recognized, "administration" of the Tax Code includes four basic steps: information gathering, assessment, levy, and collection.

No extractions found.

It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and file certain returns, ยง6001; specifies that taxpayers with qualifying incomes must file returns, ยง6012; and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for taxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent ones, ยง6020.

The Omnibus Clause nowhere suggests that "only some of" the processes in the Tax Code are covered, ante, at 5, or that the line between covered and uncovered processes is drawn at some vague notion of "proceeding."
0.88: (the line; is drawn at; some vague notion of "proceeding)

The Omnibus Clause does not use the word "proceeding" at all, but instead refers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more than that.

Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the Court turns to context.
0.868: (the Court; turns to; context)
0.772: (its proposed limit; to be find in; the text)

However, its two contextual arguments fare no better.
No extractions found.

First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must be limited to pending or imminent proceedings because the other clauses of ยง7212 are limited to actions "taken against individual identifiable persons or property."
0.895: (the other clauses of ยง7212; are limited to; actions "taken against individual identifiable persons or property)
0.655: (actions; be "taken against; individual identifiable persons or property)

But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit the scope of a general omnibus clause.

See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 225 (2008) (explaining that the ejusdem generis canon does not apply to a "disjunctive" phrase in a statute "with one specific and one general category").
0.822: (the ejusdem generis canon; does not apply to; a "disjunctive " phrase)

Nor do the other clauses in ยง7212 contain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement that the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause.
0.764: (the Court; reads into; the Omnibus Clause)
0.66: (the other clauses; do contain; the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement)

See ยง7212(a) (prohibiting efforts to "intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity"); ยง7212(b) (prohibiting "forcibly rescu[ing] or caus[ing] to be rescued any property after it shall have been seized under this title").
0.806: (it; shall have been seized under; this title)
0.717: (any officer or employee of the United States; acting in; an official capacity)

They thus provide no support for the Court's atextual limitation.

But there is no redundancy problem because these provisions have different mens rea requirements.
0.659: (these provisions; have; different mens rea requirements)

The Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done "corruptly," but the misdemeanor provisions require that an act be done "willfully."
No extractions found.

The difference between these mens rea requirements is significant.
0.716: (The difference; is; significant)
0.441: (significant; be The difference between; these mens rea requirements)

While "willfully" requires proof only "that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty," Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991), "corruptly" requires proof that the defendant "act[ed] with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other person," United States v. Floyd, 740 F. 3d 22, 31 (CA1 2014) (collecting cases); see also Black's Law Dictionary 414 (rev. 4th ed.

In other words, "corruptly" requires proof that the defendant not only knew he was obtaining an "unlawful benefit" but that his "objective" or "purpose" was to obtain that unlawful benefit.

Unless the Court means to cast doubt on this well-established principle, it should not casually dismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omnibus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax Code.

For better or worse, redundancy abounds in both the criminal law and the Tax Code.
0.838: (redundancy; abounds in; the criminal law and the Tax Code)

This Court has repeatedly declined to depart from the plain meaning of the text simply because the same conduct would be criminalized under two or more provisions.
0.793: (This Court; has repeatedly declined to depart from; the plain meaning of the text)
0.781: (the same conduct; simply would be criminalized under; two or more provisions)

See, e.g., Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.

In fact, the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy.

0.27: (the Court 's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause; does not eliminate the redundancy in; fact)
0.262: (the redundancy; does not eliminate in; fact)

Certain misdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code--such as failing to obey a summons, ยง7210--apply to conduct that takes place during a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the Omnibus Clause under the Court's interpretation.
0.695: (the Omnibus Clause; thus would be still violate under; the Court 's interpretation)
0.622: (Certain misdemeanor offenses; takes place during; a proceeding)
0.597: (Certain misdemeanor offenses; takes; place)

The Court's interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause largely redundant with 18 U. S. C. ยง1505, which already prohibits "corruptly . . . endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States."
0.892: (any pending proceeding; is being had before; any department or agency of the United States)
0.588: (any pending proceeding; is being had in; the law)
0.569: (the Omnibus Clause; be largely redundant with; 18 U. S. C. ยง1505)

Avoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the Court's interpretation.

No extractions found.

The omnibus clause of ยง1503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct "the due administration of justice."

0.234: (cause; be interpreted 18 U. S. C. ยง1512( b )( 2 )( A ) , which prohibits "knowingly . . with; intent to)

Relying on Aguilar, the Court concluded that ยง1512(b)(2)(A) required the Government to show a "nexus" with "[a] particular proceeding."

If anything, then, ยง1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court's interpretation of the Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress knows how to impose a "proceeding" requirement when it wants to do so.

First, the conditions that trigger Ake's application are present.
No extractions found.

McWilliams is and was an "indigent defendant," 470 U. S., at 70, and his "mental condition" was both "relevant to . . . the punishment he might suffer," id., at 80, and "seriously in question," id., at 70.

0.716: (this Court; rejects; Alabama 's claim)[enabler=because McWilliams received brief assistance from a volunteer psychologist at the University of Alabama]

Even if the episodic help of an outside volunteer could satisfy Ake, the State does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that the volunteer psychologist was available to the defense at the judicial sentencing proceeding.

Second, we reject Alabama's claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the assistance of Dr. Rosenszweig, the psychologist at the University of Alabama who "volunteer[ed]" to help defense counsel "in her spare time" and suggested the defense ask for further testing, P. C. T. 251-252.

Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested that Dr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.

We granted review in this case to decide a straightforward legal question on which the lower courts are divided: whether our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.

It is also significant that the Ake Court had no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake was denied the assistance of any psychiatrist--neutral or otherwise--for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of the offense or his mental state as it related to capital sentencing.

MOORE v. TEXAS, (2017)
No extractions found.

No. 15-797
No extractions found.

Argued: November 29, 2016    Decided: March 28, 2017
No extractions found.

Petitioner Moore was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for fatally shooting a store clerk during a botched robbery that occurred when Moore was 20 years old.
0.924: (Petitioner Moore; was convicted of; capital murder)
0.918: (Petitioner Moore; be sentenced to; death)
0.769: (a store clerk; be fatally shooting during; a botched robbery that occurred when Moore was 20 years old)
0.722: (Moore; was; old)

A state habeas court subsequently determined that, under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, and Hall v. Florida, 572 U. S. ___, Moore qualified as intellectually disabled and that his death sentence therefore violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of "cruel and unusual punishments."
0.881: (Florida; qualified as; disabled)
0.881: (Moore; qualified as; disabled)
0.8: (his death sentence; therefore violated; the Eighth Amendment 's proscription of " cruel and unusual punishments)
0.746: (Florida; qualified in; 572 U. S. ___)
0.589: (Moore; qualified in; 572 U. S. ___)

The court consulted current medical diagnostic standards--the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities clinical manual (AAIDD-11) and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.
0.87: (The court; consulted; current medical diagnostic standards--the 11th edition of the American Association)
0.692: (Mental Disorders; be published by; the American Psychiatric Association)
0.355: (the American Association; be the 5th edition of; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)

The habeas court followed the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits, (2) adaptive deficits, and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.
0.802: (The habeas court; followed; the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition which identifies three core elements)
0.564: (three core elements; be identifies by; the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition)

Moore's IQ scores, the court determined, established subaverage intellectual functioning.
No extractions found.

The court credited six scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability.
0.806: (70.66; indicated; mild intellectual disability)
0.778: (The court; credited; six scores)

And relying on testimony from mental-health professionals, the court found significant adaptive deficits in all three skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).
0.829: (the court; found; significant adaptive deficits)

Based on its findings, the habeas court recommended to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that Moore be granted relief.
0.916: (the habeas court; recommended to; the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)
0.809: (Moore; be granted; relief)

The CCA declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the habeas court.
0.87: (The CCA; declined to adopt; the judgment recommended by the habeas court)
0.793: (the judgment; be recommended by; the habeas court)

The CCA held instead that the habeas court erred by not following the CCA's 2004 decision in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1, which adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation manual (AAMR-9), predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.
0.699: (Ex parte Briseno; 3d; 1 which adopted the definition of , and standards for assessing , intellectual disability contained in the 1992 ( ninth ) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation manual ( AAMR-9) , predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual)
0.699: (intellectual disability; be contained in; 1992)
0.624: (1; adopted standards; of , and standards)

Briseno also incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits must be "related" to intellectual-functioning deficits, and it recited, without citation to any medical or judicial authority, seven evidentiary factors relevant to the intellectual-disability inquiry.
0.826: (it; recited without; citation)
0.804: (adaptive deficits; must be "related to; intellectual-functioning deficits)
0.452: (Briseno; be relevant to; the intellectual-disability inquiry)

Based on only two of Moore's IQ scores (of 74 and 78), the CCA concluded that Moore had not shown significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.
0.732: (Moore; had not shown; subaverage intellectual functioning)

And even if he had, the CCA continued, his adaptive strengths undercut any adaptive weaknesses.
0.853: (his adaptive strengths; undercut; any adaptive weaknesses)

The habeas court also failed, the CCA determined, to inquire into relatedness.
0.81: (the CCA; determined to inquire into; relatedness)
0.81: (the CCA; to inquire into; relatedness)

Among alternative causes for Moore's adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.
0.819: (an abuse-filled childhood , undiagnosed learning disorders , multiple elementary-school transfers , racially motivated harassment and violence; suggested among; alternative causes)
0.809: (the CCA; suggested among; alternative causes)
0.791: (an abuse-filled childhood , undiagnosed learning disorders , multiple elementary-school transfers , racially motivated harassment and violence; be a history of; academic failure)
0.641: (the CCA; be a history of; academic failure)
0.575: (an abuse-filled childhood , undiagnosed learning disorders , multiple elementary-school transfers , racially motivated harassment and violence; be violence at; school)
0.39: (the CCA; be violence at; school)

Briseno's seven evidentiary factors, the CCA further determined, weighed against finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement.
0.732: (Moore; had satisfied; the relatedness requirement)

Held: By rejecting the habeas court's application of medical guidance and by following the Briseno standard, including the nonclinical Briseno factors, the CCA's decision does not comport with the Eighth Amendment and this Court's precedents.
0.864: (the CCA 's decision; does not comport with; the Eighth Amendment and this Court 's precedents)

(a) The Eighth Amendment, which " 'reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,' " Hall, 572 U. S., at ___, prohibits the execution of any intellectually disabled individual, Atkins, 536 U. S., at 321.

(b) The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall, which instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's "standard error of measurement."

The medical community, however, counts traumatic experiences as risk factors for intellectual disability.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)1 declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court.2 In the CCA's view, the habeas court erroneously employed intellectual-disability guides currently used in the medical community rather than the 1992 guides adopted by the CCA in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.

Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways it might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas--conceptual, social, and practical--should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform a skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.

You would not know it from reading the Court's opinion today, but that is precisely what the CCA--the factfinder under Texas law--did in the decision below: Confronted with dueling expert opinions about how to evaluate adaptive functioning and what conclusion to reach, the CCA resolved the dispute before it by accepting the testimony of the expert it deemed most credible.

As for how I would resolve this case, there is one aspect of the CCA's approach to intellectual disability that is incompatible with the Eighth Amendment: the Briseno factors.
0.626: (I; would resolve; this case)

As the Court explains, no state legislature has approved the use of these or any similar factors.
0.765: (no state legislature; has approved; the use of these)[enabler=As the Court explains]

Although the CCA reviewed these factors to determine whether Moore's adaptive deficits were "related" to his intellectual functioning, it may be that consideration of those factors tainted the whole of the CCA's adaptive functioning analysis.
0.775: (it; may be that; consideration of those factors)
0.747: (Moore 's adaptive deficits; were "related to; his intellectual functioning)

I need not decide this question, however, because the CCA reached the issue of Moore's adaptive functioning only after concluding that he had failed to demonstrate intellectual functioning sufficiently low to warrant a finding of intellectual disability, regardless of his adaptive deficits or their relationship to his IQ.
No extractions found.

Hall rejected a Florida rule that required a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to demonstrate intellectual disability, thereby barring consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) of an over-70 score.
0.632: (Hall; rejected; a Florida rule)

But the CCA did not apply Florida's rule--or anything like it.
0.788: (the CCA; did not apply; Florida 's rule--or anything)

The court in fact began by taking account of the SEM, explaining that Moore's tested score of 74 led to an IQ range between 69 and 79.
0.88: (Moore 's tested score of 74; led to; an IQ range)

The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.
0.79: (The court; to consider; additional expert testimony)
0.734: (The court; went to consider; additional expert testimony)

Based on that evidence, the CCA discounted portions of the SEM-generated range and concluded that Moore's IQ did not lie in the relevant range for intellectual disability.
0.845: (the CCA; discounted; portions of the SEM-generated range)
0.813: (Moore 's IQ; did not lie in; the relevant range)
0.744: (Moore 's IQ; did not lie for; intellectual disability)

Hall provided no definitive guidance on this sort of approach: recognizing the inherent imprecision of IQ tests, but considering additional evidence to determine whether an SEM-generated range of scores accurately reflected a prisoner's actual IQ.1 Indeed, in its catalog of States that "ha[d] taken a position contrary to that of Florida," the Court in Hall included a State that granted trial courts discretion to draw "reasonable inferences" about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the SEM.
0.83: (Hall; provided no definitive guidance on; this sort of approach)
0.82: (the Court; included; a State)
0.795: (no definitive guidance; be provided on; this sort of approach)

572 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 15, 16) (quoting Pizzuto v. State, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P. 3d 642, 651 (2008)).2 That is the approach the CCA took here.
0.183: (__ _; be 572 U. S. at; ___)

If that approach was "contrary" to Florida's rule in Hall, I do not understand how Hall can be read to reject that approach today.
0.072: (that approach; was; contrary)

The Court's ruling on intellectual functioning turns solely on the fact that Moore's IQ range was 69 to 79 rather than 70 to 80.
0.834: (The Court 's ruling; turns on; the fact that Moore 's IQ range was 69 to 79)
0.622: (Moore 's IQ range; was; 69)

See ante, at 11 ("Because the lower end of Moore's score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning").
0.837: (ante; be See at; 11)

The CCA certainly did not "disregard" SEM in assessing Moore's IQ, and it explained why other factors led it to conclude that his actual score did not fall near the lower end of the SEM range.
0.859: (his actual score; did not fall near; the lower end of the SEM range)

Only by insisting on the absolute conformity to medical standards the Court disclaims can it find a violation of the Eighth Amendment based on that one-point difference.3 Ibid.
0.681: (a violation of the Eighth Amendment; be based on; that one-point difference)
0.654: (the Court disclaims; can find; a violation of the Eighth Amendment)
0.556: (it; can find; a violation of the Eighth Amendment)

In concluding that the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score, the Court today is just as wrong as the Florida Supreme Court was in Hall.
0.791: (the Eighth Amendment; turns on; the slightest numerical difference)
0.776: (the Court; is just as wrong as; the Florida Supreme Court)
0.764: (the Court; is just as; wrong)

Today's decision is not compelled by Hall; it is an expansion of it.
0.883: (Today 's decision; is not compelled by; Hall)
0.854: (it; is an expansion of; it)
0.612: (it; is; an expansion of it)

Perhaps there are reasons to expand Hall's holding--to say that States must read IQ tests as rigidly encompassing the entire SEM range, regardless of any other evidentiary considerations, or to say that the reasons that the CCA gave for discounting the lower end of Moore's IQ range were improper.
0.825: (that States; must read; IQ tests)[attrib=reasons to expand Hall 's say]

But before holding that the Constitution demands either result, our precedent requires consulting state judgments on the matter to determine whether a national consensus has developed.
0.612: (the Constitution; demands; either result)

Moore has presented no argument as to such a consensus, and the majority does not claim that there is one.

0.49: (the majority; has presented does; no argument)

These cases concern Colorado's rules for determining whether a defendant can obtain a refund of money that he or she was required to pay pursuant to a judgment of conviction that is later reversed.
0.775: (a defendant; can obtain; a refund of money)

In holding that these payments must be refunded, the Court relies on a feature of the criminal law, the presumption of innocence.
0.851: (the Court; relies on; a feature of the criminal law)

And since the Court demands that refunds occur either automatically or at least without imposing anything more than "minimal" procedures, see ante, at 10, it appears that they must generally occur as part of the criminal case.

The majority and concurring opinions debate whether the procedural due process framework of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), or that of Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992), governs the question before us.

A Colorado jury convicted petitioner Peรฑa-Rodriguez of harassment and unlawful sexual contact.
0.83: (A Colorado jury; convicted; petitioner Peรฑa-Rodriguez of harassment)

Following the discharge of the jury, two jurors told defense counsel that, during deliberations, Juror H. C. had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner's alibi witness.
0.87: (two jurors; told; defense counsel that , during deliberations , Juror H. C. had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner 's alibi witness)

0.592: (two jurors; told defense counsel that , during deliberations , Juror H. C. had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner 's alibi witness following; the discharge of the jury)
0.387: (Juror H. C.; had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner 's alibi witness during; deliberations)

Counsel, with the trial court's supervision, obtained affidavits from the two jurors describing a number of biased statements by H. C.
0.945: (Counsel; obtained affidavits from; the two jurors describing a number of biased statements by H. C.)

0.689: (a number of biased statements; be describing by; H. C.)
0.643: (the two jurors; describing a number of biased statements by; H. C.)

The court acknowledged H. C.'s apparent bias but denied petitioner's motion for a new trial on the ground that Colorado Rule of Evidence 606(b) generally prohibits a juror from testifying as to statements made during deliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of the verdict.
0.769: (statements; be made into; the validity of the verdict)

The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that H. C.'s alleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule 606(b).
0.813: (H. C. 's alleged statements; did not fall within; an exception)

The Colorado Supreme Court also affirmed, relying on Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, and Warger v. Shauers, 574 U. S. ___, both of which rejected constitutional challenges to the federal no-impeachment rule as applied to evidence of juror misconduct or bias.
0.917: (rejected constitutional challenges; as applied to; evidence of juror misconduct)

0.712: (The Colorado Supreme Court; also affirmed relying on; Tanner)
0.364: (rejected constitutional challenges; also affirmed relying on; Tanner)
0.339: (Warger; also affirmed relying on; Tanner)

Held: Where a juror makes a clear statement indicating that he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror's statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.

Since the Court's decision mandates the admission of the testimony of one juror about a statement made by another juror during deliberations, what the Court must mean in making this argument is that jurors are less willing to report biased comments by fellow jurors prior to the beginning of deliberations (while they are still sitting with the biased juror) than they are after the verdict is announced and the jurors have gone home.

As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that "[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs' version of the facts, a reasonable person in the officers' position should have understood their conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to defend their home and could result in the commission of deadly force against Samuel Pauly by Officer White."

The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White's position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.

Of course, "general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning" to officers, United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 271 (1997), but "in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent," Anderson v. Creighton, supra, at 640.

Of course, "general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning" to officers, United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 271 (1997), but "in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent," Anderson v. Creighton, supra, at 640.

For that reason, we have held that Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly established law outside "an obvious case."

This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under Garner and Graham.

Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct--such as his failure to shout a warning--constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation.

This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a "clearly established" right.
0.666: (White 's conduct; did not violate; a " clearly established " right)

Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed.
0.867: (federal law; does not prohibit; a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures , such as officer identification , have already been followed)

The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel's shots were fired.

0.568: (Officer White; arrived in; the scene)[attrib=respondents contend]

On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other officers' deficient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly force.

I join the Court's opinion on the understanding that it does not foreclose the denial of summary judgment to Officers Truesdale and Mariscal.
0.768: (the denial of summary judgment; does not foreclose to; Officers Truesdale and Mariscal)
0.704: (I; join; the Court 's opinion)
0.681: (it; does not foreclose; the denial of summary judgment)
0.661: (it; does not foreclose the denial of summary judgment to; Officers Truesdale and Mariscal)

See 814 F. 3d 1060, 1068, 1073, 1074 (CA10 2016) (Court of Appeals emphasized, repeatedly, that fact disputes exist on question whether Truesdale and Mariscal "adequately identified themselves" as police officers before shouting "Come out or we're coming in" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
0.809: (fact disputes; exist on; question)

Further, as to Officer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Officer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Officer White shot Pauly.
0.903: (Officer White; arrived at; the scene)
