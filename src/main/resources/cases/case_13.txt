The District Court also noted that Tharpe could not overcome that procedural default because he had failed to produce any clear and convincing evidence contradicting the state court's determination that Gattie's presence on the jury did not prejudice him.
The Eleventh Circuit denied his COA application after deciding that jurists of reason could not dispute that the District Court's procedural ruling was correct.
The Eleventh Circuit's decision, as we read it, was based solely on its conclusion, rooted in the state court's factfinding, that Tharpe had failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally defaulted claim, i.e., that Tharpe had "failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
In light of the standard for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), which is available only in " 'extraordinary circumstances,' " Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 536 (2005), Tharpe faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could disagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion.
It may be that, at the end of the day, Tharpe should not receive a COA.
But their odiousness does not excuse us from doing our job correctly, or allow us to pretend that the lower courts have not done theirs.
As aggravating factors, the jury found that Tharpe murdered Freeman while committing two other capital felonies--the aggravated kidnapings of his wife and Freeman--and that the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman.
The resulting affidavit stated that Gattie knew Freeman, and that her family was "what [he] would call a nice [b]lack family."
The affidavit continued that, in Gattie's view, "there are two types of black people: 1.
Gattie's affidavit went on to explain that "[a]fter studying the Bible," he had "wondered if black people even have souls."
The affidavit also noted that some of the other jurors "wanted blacks to know they weren't going to get away with killing each other."
In that second affidavit, Gattie stated that he "did not vote to impose the death penalty because [Tharpe] was a black man," but instead because the evidence presented at trial justified it and because Tharpe showed no remorse.
The affidavit explained that Gattie had consumed "seven or more beers" on the afternoon he signed the first affidavit.
He also attested that many of the statements in the first affidavit "were taken out of context and simply not accurate."
And he felt that the lawyers who took it "were deceiving and misrepresented what they stood for."
Gattie again testified that, although he signed the affidavit, he did not swear to its contents.
Gattie also testified that when he signed the affidavit he had consumed "[m]aybe a 12 pack, [and] a few drinks of whiskey, over the period of the day."
The ten jurors who testified all said that race played no role in the jury's deliberations.
One of his claims was that "improper racial animus . . . infected the deliberations of the jury."
Second, Tharpe had procedurally defaulted his claim because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal, and he could not establish cause and prejudice to overcome that default.
The District Court acknowledged that ineffective assistance of counsel can provide cause to overcome a procedural default, but it explained that Tharpe "fail[ed] to provide any details regarding this allegation."
The District Court concluded that Tharpe "ha[d] not established that his counsels' ineffectiveness constituted cause to overcome the procedural defaul[t]" and that he "failed to show actual prejudice."
According to Tharpe, Buck established that extraordinary circumstances are present when a defendant was sentenced due to his race and new law provides an opportunity to consider the merits of his previously defaulted, race-based sentencing claim.
Pena-Rodriguez supplied that new law, Tharpe argued, because it held that a state no-impeachment rule must yield when there is a "clear statement that indicates [a juror] relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant."
It first explained that Pena-Rodriguez announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively on federal collateral review.
The District Court deferred to that credibility determination, and nothing in Pena-Rodriguez undermined that determination.
It explained that the District Court had concluded in its first decision that Tharpe failed to prove cause and prejudice.
"As the [state court] and the District Court found, Tharpe failed to demonstrate that Barney Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
"Nor," the Eleventh Circuit continued, "has Tharpe shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "
The Court is not willing to say that Tharpe can satisfy this standard.
See ante, at 3 ("It may be that, at the end of the day, Tharpe should not receive a COA").
It does not read the decision as reaching cause, and it declines to consider that or any other alternative reason to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.
The Eleventh Circuit first held that Tharpe had failed to make a " 'substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,' " explaining that he had "failed to demonstrate that . . . Gattie's behavior 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' "
Then the Eleventh Circuit alternatively held that Tharpe had not "shown that 'jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.' "
Indeed, neither party suggests that the Eleventh Circuit's decision did not reach cause, and both parties briefed the issue to this Court.
In fact, "[a]n appropriately self-respecting response to today's summary vacatur would be summary reissuance of the same opinion," ibid., with a sentence clarifying that the Eleventh Circuit agrees with the District Court's decision on cause.
The Court acknowledges that our review "is certainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court whose decision is under review."
The Court's self-imposed limitation is inexcusable given that Tharpe's collateral challenges to his sentence have lasted 24 years, the Court's failure to consider alternative grounds has halted an imminent execution, the alternative grounds were reached below, several of them were briefed here, and many of them are obviously correct.
First, no reasonable jurist could argue that Pena-Rodriguez applies retroactively on collateral review.
Pena-Rodriguez established a new rule: The opinion states that it is answering a question "left open" by this Court's earlier precedents.
Since Pena-Rodriguez permits a trial court "to consider [certain] evidence," 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17), and does not "alte[r] the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes," Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 353 (2004), it cannot be a substantive rule.2 And Tharpe does not even attempt to argue that Pena-Rodriguez established a watershed rule of criminal procedure--a class of rules that is so "narrow" that it is " 'unlikely that any has yet to emerge.' "
Second, no reasonable jurist could argue that Tharpe demonstrated cause for his procedural default.
No reasonable jurist could debate that decision.
In his reply brief in support of certiorari in this Court, Tharpe argues that he did not have to raise his claim of juror bias on direct appeal.
The state court's finding that Tharpe "failed to show that any alleged racial bias of Mr. Gattie's was the basis for sentencing" him, App.
He also denied having sworn to the first affidavit and explained that he had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol on the day he signed it.
Gattie's testimony was consistent with the testimony of the other ten jurors deposed in front of the trial court, each of whom testified that they did not consider race and that race was not discussed during their deliberations.
Instead, the relevant question is whether a reasonable jurist could argue that the District Court abused its discretion by concluding that the state court's decision to credit Gattie's testimony has not been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.
Even if "[r]easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about" the evidence, "on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the [state] court's credibility determination."
Under these standards, no reasonable jurist could argue that Tharpe rebutted the state court's decision by clear and convincing evidence, much less that the District Court's deference to the state court's credibility determination was an abuse of discretion.
It openly anticipates that he will not be able to obtain a COA, which makes sense given the insurmountable barriers he faces on remand.
The Eleventh Circuit also held that Tharpe had not exhausted his Pena-Rodriguez claim in state court.
Moreover, because the state court considered Tharpe's evidence of racial bias anyway, despite Georgia's no-impeachment rule, no reasonable jurist could argue that Pena-Rodriguez presents an extraordinary circumstance that entitles Tharpe to reopen his judgment under Rule 60(b).
Even if Tharpe could show that Pena-Rodriguez is retroactive under Teague and could overcome his procedural default, no reasonable jurist could argue that he has stated a valid juror-bias claim on the merits.
The state court concluded that his claim failed in the absence of any admissible evidence to support it.
To obtain federal habeas relief, Tharpe must show that this merits decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."
Since the state court issued its decision nearly a decade before Pena-Rodriguez, no reasonable jurist could argue that the state court's decision was contrary to clearly established law at "the time the state court render[ed] its decision."
