In 2008, federal officials received a tip from a confidential informant that Lee had sold the informant ecstasy and marijuana.

After obtaining a warrant, the officials searched Lee's house, where they found drugs, cash, and a loaded rifle.
0.818: (they; found; drugs)
0.756: (the officials; searched; Lee 's house)

Lee admitted that the drugs were his, and a grand jury indicted him on one count of possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute.
0.957: (his , and a grand jury; indicted him on; one count possessing ecstasy with intent)[attrib=Lee admitted]
0.835: (his , and a grand jury; indicted; him)[attrib=Lee admitted]

0.92: (Lee; entered into; plea discussions)

Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.
0.883: (Lee; was sentenced to; a year and a day)
0.821: (Lee; accepted; a plea)

Lee had in fact pleaded guilty to an "aggravated felony" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. ยง1101(a)(43)(B), so he was, contrary to his attorney's advice, subject to mandatory deportation as a result of that plea.

0.92: (Lee; learned of; this consequence)
0.776: (his attorney; had provided; ineffective assistance)
0.761: (he; filed; a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence)

At an evidentiary hearing, both Lee and his plea-stage counsel testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee in deciding whether to accept a plea, and Lee's counsel acknowledged that although Lee's defense to the charge was weak, if he had known Lee would be deported upon pleading guilty, he would have advised him to go to trial.

The District Court, however, denied relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
0.691: (The District Court; however denied; relief)
0.507: (the Sixth Circuit; however denied; relief)

Applying the two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee could not show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.
0.75: (he; was prejudiced by; his attorney 's erroneous advice)[attrib=Lee could not show]

Held: Lee has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel's erroneous advice.
0.76: (he; was prejudiced by; his counsel 's erroneous advice)

(a) When a defendant claims that his counsel's deficient performance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."

Lee contends that he can make this showing because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation.
0.693: (the result; would be; deportation)
0.535: (he; can make; this showing)[enabler=because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation;attrib=Lee contends]

The Government contends that Lee cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to acquittal.
0.671: (Lee; cannot show; prejudice)[attrib=The Government contends]

Pp. 5-8.

(b) The Government makes two errors in urging the adoption of a per se rule that a defendant with no viable defense cannot show prejudice from the denial of his right to trial.
0.788: (The Government; makes; two errors)
0.712: (a defendant; cannot show; prejudice)
0.638: (b; makes; two errors)

First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that demands a "case-by-case examination" of the "totality of the evidence."

0.497: (466 U. S.; be Strickland at; 695)

More fundamentally, it overlooks that the Hill v. Lockhart inquiry focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.
0.893: (Lockhart inquiry; focuses on; a defendant 's decisionmaking which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial)
0.839: (the Hill; focuses on; a defendant 's decisionmaking which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial)

The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.
0.743: (the respective consequences of a conviction; be assessing after; trial and by plea)
0.743: (the respective consequences of a conviction; be assessing by; trial and by plea)

When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.

For Lee, deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time; he says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation in favor of throwing a "Hail Mary" at trial.
0.785: (he; accordingly would have rejected; any plea leading to deportation in favor)[attrib=he says]
0.716: (any plea; leading in; favor throwing a " Hail Mary " at trial)
0.701: (any plea; leading to; deportation)

That statement, however, was made in the context of discussing the presumption of reliability applied to judicial proceedings, which has no place where, as here, a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether.

0.606: (no place where , as here , a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether; be has by; judicial proceedings)

When the inquiry is focused on what an individual defendant would have done, the possibility of even a highly improbable result may be pertinent to the extent it would have affected the defendant's decisionmaking.

(c) Courts should not upset a plea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.

0.721: (a plea; should be not upset solely because of; post hoc assertions)

Rather, they should look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences.
0.898: (they; Rather should look to; contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant 's expressed preferences)

In the unusual circumstances of this case, Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation: Both Lee and his attorney testified that "deportation was the determinative issue" to Lee; his responses during his plea colloquy confirmed the importance he placed on deportation; and he had strong connections to the United States, while he had no ties to South Korea.

0.3: (Lee and his attorney; be his responses during; his plea colloquy)
0.157: (he; be his responses during; his plea colloquy)

The Government argues that Lee cannot "convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances," Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. 356, 372, since deportation would almost certainly result from a trial.
0.784: (deportation; would almost certainly result from; a trial)

0.719: (Padilla; 559; U. S. 356)[enabler=since deportation would almost certainly result from a trial]
0.581: (Lee; cannot convince; the court)

Unlike the Government, this Court cannot say that it would be irrational for someone in Lee's position to risk additional prison time in exchange for holding on to some chance of avoiding deportation.
0.679: (additional prison time; to be risk in; exchange)
0.678: (it; would be irrational for; someone)[attrib=this Court cannot say]

As a general matter, it makes sense that a defendant who has no realistic defense to a charge supported by sufficient evidence will be unable to carry his burden of showing prejudice from accepting a guilty plea.

But in elevating this general proposition to a per se rule, the Government makes two errors.
0.761: (the Government; makes; two errors)

First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that we have emphasized demands a "case-by-case examination" of the "totality of the evidence."

And, more fundamentally, the Government overlooks that the inquiry we prescribed in Hill v. Lockhart focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.

A defendant without any viable defense will be highly likely to lose at trial.
0.788: (A defendant; will be highly; likely)

And a defendant facing such long odds will rarely be able to show prejudice from accepting a guilty plea that offers him a better resolution than would be likely after trial.
0.724: (such long odds; will rarely be; able)
0.723: (such long odds; to show; prejudice)

But that is not because the prejudice inquiry in this context looks to the probability of a conviction for its own sake.

It is instead because defendants obviously weigh their prospects at trial in deciding whether to accept a plea.

In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.
0.678: (the defendant; to go to; trial)

It focused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more favorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at the suppression hearing.

The Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant "would have accepted the earlier plea offer," it is also "necessary" to show a "reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time."

The dissent makes much of the fact that Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), also noted that courts should ignore the "idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker."

As we have explained, assessing the effect of some types of attorney errors on defendants' decisionmaking involves such predictions: Where an attorney error allegedly affects how a trial would have played out, we analyze that error's effects on a defendant's decisionmaking by making a prediction of the likely trial outcome.
0.758: (we; analyze that; error 's effects)
0.718: (such predictions; analyze that; error 's effects)

But, as Hill recognized, such predictions will not always be "necessary."

Such a prediction is neither necessary nor appropriate where, as here, the error is one that is not alleged to be pertinent to a trial outcome, but is instead alleged to have affected a defendant's understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.

Several courts have noted that a judge's warnings at a plea colloquy may undermine a claim that the defendant was prejudiced by his attorney's misadvice.
0.827: (the defendant; was prejudiced by; his attorney 's misadvice)
0.712: (a judge 's warnings; may undermine; a claim)

See, e.g., United States v. Newman, 805 F. 3d 1143, 1147 (CADC 2015); United States v. Kayode, 777 F. 3d 719, 728-729 (CA5 2014); United States v. Akinsade, 686 F. 3d 248, 253 (CA4 2012); Boyd v. Yukins, 99 Fed.

The present case involves a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel extending to advice specifically undermining the judge's warnings themselves, which the defendant contemporaneously stated on the record he did not understand.

0.783: (the defendant; which contemporaneously stated on; the record)
0.526: (counsel; extending to; advice specifically undermining the judge 's warnings themselves ,)

There has been no suggestion here that the sentencing judge's statements at the plea colloquy cured any prejudice from the erroneous advice of Lee's counsel.
0.88: (the sentencing judge 's statements; cured any prejudice from; the erroneous advice of Lee 's counsel)
0.831: (any prejudice; be cured from; the erroneous advice of Lee 's counsel)
