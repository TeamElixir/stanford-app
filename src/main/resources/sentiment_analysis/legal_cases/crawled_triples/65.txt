(relationship, demonstrated at, all) [The Court of Appeals reversed because the relationship between Test 21 and training school success, if demonstrated at all, did not satisfy what it deemed to be the crucial requirement [426 U.S. 229, 250] � of a direct relationship between performance on Test 21 and performance on the policeman's job.]
