(outpouring, take, factors) ["Recent years have seen an outpouring of popular concern for what has come to be known as `victims' rights' - a phrase that describes what its proponents feel is the failure of courts of justice to take into account in their sentencing decisions not only the factors mitigating the defendant's moral guilt, but also the amount of harm he has caused to innocent members of society.]
