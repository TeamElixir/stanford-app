(it, follows, that) [This being so, it follows that due process - "using that term in its primary sense of an opportunity to be heard and to defend [a] . . . substantive right," Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill, 281 U.S. 673, 678 - requires a State to allow a litigant [361 U.S. 147, 172] � in some manner to introduce proof on this score.]
