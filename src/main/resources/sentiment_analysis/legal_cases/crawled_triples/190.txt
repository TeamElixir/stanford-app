(trial court, has, apparent view) [By use of the conjunctive to incorporate the requirement of loss of control, this instruction indicates the trial court's apparent view that if the drug had the effect of overbearing the petitioner's will but did not also cause loss of [372 U.S. 293, 324] � memory, the confession would nonetheless remain acceptable evidence of guilt.]
