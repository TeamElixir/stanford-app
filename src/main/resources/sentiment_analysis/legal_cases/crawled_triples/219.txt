(language, n., supra) [[ Footnote 23 ] As presently codified, 242 begins: "Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . ." This language differs from the comparable language of 1983, n. 15, supra, in several respects.]
(custom, is in, 1983) [For example: "law" precedes "statute" in 242, but not in 1983; "or usage" follows "custom" in 1983, but not in 242; the entire enumeration "statute . . . usage" is qualified by "of any State or Territory" in 1983, but not in 242; 1983 refers to rights that are "secured," whereas 242 refers to rights "secured or protected"; 1983 covers rights secured "by the Constitution and laws" (emphasis added), whereas 242 covers rights secured or protected "by the Constitution or laws of the United States" (emphasis added); 242 reaches only acts done "willfully," but 1983 is not so limited.]
