(It, begins, asking) [It begins by asking what is its essential question: Why would the Forty-second Congress, which clearly provided tort relief in the federal courts for violations of constitutional rights by acts of a policeman acting pursuant to state authority, not also have provided the same relief for violations of constitutional rights by a policeman acting in violation of state authority?]
(Congress, distinguish between, two situations) [What, it inquires, would cause a Congress to distinguish between the two situations?]
(365 U.S. 167 248, Examining, possible distinction) [[365 U.S. 167, 248] � Examining the other possible distinction - the difference between injuries to individuals from isolated acts of abuse of authority by state officers and injuries to individuals from acts sanctioned by the dignity of state law - it finds that this, too, could not have been important, especially to a Congress which was aware of the existence of state constitutional guarantees of protection to the individual, and which enacted the conspiracy statute which became R. S. 1980 and is now 42 U.S.C. 1985.]
(piece, power of, National Government) [The legislative process of the post-bellum Congresses which enacted the several Civil Rights Acts was one of struggle and compromise in which the power of the National Government was expanded piece by piece against bitter resistance; the Radicals of 1871 had to yield ground and bargain over detail in order to keep the moderate Republicans in line.]

(Congress, reached, one situation) [To assume that if Congress reached one situation it would also have reached another situation involving not dissimilar problems - assuming, arguendo, that the problems, viewed in intellectual abstraction, are not dissimilar - ignores the temper of the times which produced the Ku Klux Act.]
(two situations, that of, 365 U.S. 167 249) [This approach would be persuasive only if the two situations, that of a [365 U.S. 167, 249] � state officer acting pursuant to state authority and that of a state officer acting without state authority, were so entirely similar that they would not, in 1871, have been perceived as two different situations at all.]

(statute, by, sponsor) [Contrariwise, it is historically persuasive that the Forty-second Congress, which was not thinking in neat abstract categories, designed a statute to protect federal constitutional rights from an immediate evil perceived to be grave - the evil described by the statute's sponsor, Mr. Shellabarger, "such wrongs . . . as are done under color of State laws which abridge these rights," 76 - but did not, by the same measure, seek to control unconstitutional action abusive of a state authority which did not, itself, "abridge these rights."]
(state trial court, has found, facts) [As to the adequacy of state-court protection of person and property, there seems a very sound distinction, as a class, between injuries sanctioned by state law (as to which there can never be state-court redress, if at all, unless (1) the state courts are sufficiently receptive to a federal claim to declare their own law unconstitutional, or (2) the litigant persists through a tortuous and protracted process of appeals, after a state trial court has found the facts, through the state-court system to this Court) and injuries not sanctioned by state law.]

(incidence, cover, bulk) [To make this line of distinction determine the incidence of Civil Rights legislation serves to cover the bulk of cases where [365 U.S. 167, 250] � federal judicial protection would be needed.]
(cost, is in, larger class of cases) [But the cost of ignoring the distinction in order to cover those cases - the cost, that is, of providing a federal judicial remedy for every constitutional violation - involves pre-emption by the National Government, in the larger class of cases in which rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment relate to interests of person and property having a state-law origin, of matters of intimate concern to state and local governments.]

(Act, for, draftsmen have selected) [Therefore, the line of distinction between state-authorized and unauthorized actions, as a line of compromise among positions concerning which the legislative evidence is clear that Congress wanted to, and did, compromise, is the most probable for the Act's draftsmen to have selected.]
(Ku Klux Act, attribute significance to, line of distinction) [To attribute significance to this line of distinction is not to reduce the Ku Klux Act to having "merely a jurisdictional function, shifting the load of federal supervision from the Supreme Court" to an original federal tribunal.]
