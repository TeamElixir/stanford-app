(suits, restrain, instituting) [Even if it were held that suits to restrain the instituting of actions directly to recover the prescribed penalties would not be suits against the state, it would not follow that we should go further and hold that a proceeding under which the state was, in effect, denied access, by its attorney general, to its own courts, would be consistent with the 11th Amendment.]
(U.S., is in, vital particulars) [This court has heretofore held that [209 U.S. 123, 204] � that could not be done, and that such a result would, for most purposes, practically obliterate the 11th Amendment, and place the states, in vital particulars, as absolutely under the control of the subordinate Federal courts, as if they were capable of being directly sued.]
(I, put, matter) [I put the matter in this way, because to forbid the attorney general of a state under the penalty of being punished as for contempt) from representing his state in suits of a particular kind, in its own courts, is to forbid the state itself from appearing and being heard in such suits.]

(court, has declared, saying) [I am justified, by what this court has heretofore declared, in now saying that the men who framed the Constitution, and who caused the adoption of the 11th Amendment, would have been amazed by the suggestion that a state of the Union can be prevented, by an order of a subordinate Federal court, from being represented by its attorney general in a suit brought by it in one of its own courts; and that such an order would be inconsistent with the dignity of the states as involved in their constitutional immunity from the judicial process of the Federal courts ( except in the limited cases in which they may constitutionally be made parties in this court), and would be attended by most pernicious results.]
