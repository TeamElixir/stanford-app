(course, is In, my view of cases) [In my view of these cases a present determination of the Constitutional issues is the only course which will advance justice, and I can find no sound reason born of considerations as to the possible inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the judgment that might be rendered which justifies the Court's contrary disposition.]

(Longshoremen, 's Union is, 347 U.S. 222) [3 There is no lack of "ripeness" in the sense that is exemplified by cases such as Stearns v. Wood, 236 U.S. 75 ; Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, 303 U.S. 419 ; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 ; International [367 U.S. 497, 528] � Longshoremen's Union v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222 ; and perhaps again Parker v. Los Angeles County, supra.]

Boyd, 347 U.S. 222 ; and perhaps again Parker v. Los Angeles County, supra.]
(need, contingency of, application) [In all of those cases the lack of ripeness inhered in the fact that the need for some further procedure, some further contingency of application or interpretation, whether judicial, administrative or executive, or some further clarification of the intentions of the claimant, served to make remote the issue which was sought to be presented to the Court.]
(further procedure, for need is, further contingency of application) [In all of those cases the lack of ripeness inhered in the fact that the need for some further procedure, some further contingency of application or interpretation, whether judicial, administrative or executive, or some further clarification of the intentions of the claimant, served to make remote the issue which was sought to be presented to the Court.]
(they, intend, do) [Certainly the appellants have stated in their pleadings fully and unequivocally what it is that they intend to do; no clarifying or resolving contingency stands in their way before they may embark on that conduct.]
(mere fact, make, case too remote) [And it is clear beyond cavil that the mere fact that a controversy such as this is rendered still more unavoidable by an actual prosecution, is not alone sufficient to make the case too remote, not ideally enough "ripe" for adjudication, at the prior stage of anticipatory relief.]

(latter, notwithstanding, characterization of record) [I cannot see what further elaboration is required to enable us to decide the appellants' claims, and indeed neither the plurality opinion nor the concurring opinion - notwithstanding the latter's characterization of this record as "skimpy" - suggests what more grist is needed before the judicial mill could turn.]
(controversy, became by, merger of two contesting interests) [333, or South Spring Hill Gold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., 145 U.S. 300 , where prior to consideration the controversy in effect became moot by the merger of the two contesting interests.]

(parties, force, adjudication) [And there is nothing to suggest that the parties by their conduct of this litigation have cooperated to force an adjudication of a Constitutional issue which - were the parties interested solely in winning their cases rather than obtaining a Constitutional decision - might not arise in an arm's-length contested proceeding.]
(Such, was, situation) [Such was the situation in Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U.S. 339 , where the parties sought a ruling as to whether a particular passenger rate was unconstitutionally confiscatory, having stipulated all the debatable and contingent facts which otherwise might have rendered a Constitutional decision unnecessary.]

(I think, is, anything) [I think it is unjustifiably stretching things to assume that appellants are not deterred by the threat of prosecution from engaging in the conduct in which they assert a right to engage, or to assume that appellee's demurrer to the proposition that he asserts the right to enforce the statute against appellants at any time he chooses is anything but a candid one.]
(I, be, developed) [Indeed, as will be developed below, I think both the plurality and concurring opinions confuse on this score the predictive likelihood that, had they not brought themselves to appellee's attention, he would not enforce the statute against them, with some entirely suppositious "tacit agreement" not to prosecute, thereby ignoring the [367 U.S. 497, 530] � prosecutor's claim, asserted in these very proceedings, of a right, at his unbounded prosecutorial discretion, to enforce the statute.]

Mellon and Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 , and Texas v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 258 U.S. 158 , do indeed stand for the proposition that a legal claim will not be considered at the instance of one who has no real and concrete interest in its vindication.]

(accord, is with, grounds for declining jurisdiction) [This is well in accord with the grounds for declining jurisdiction suggested above.]

(I, do understand, argument be) [Nor do I understand the argument to be that this is the sort of claim which is too remote ever to be pressed by anyone, because no one is ever sufficiently involved.]
(Cf. Massachusetts, Frothingham v., Mellon) [Cf. Massachusetts v. Mellon, Frothingham v. Mellon, supra.]
(parties, is in, truth) [Thus, in truth, it is not the parties pressing this claim but the occasion chosen for pressing it which is objected to.]
(refusal, exercise, our appellate jurisdiction) [We are brought, then, to the precise failing in these proceedings which is said to justify refusal to exercise our mandatory appellate jurisdiction: that there has been but one recorded Connecticut case dealing with a prosecution under the statute.]

(adjudication, is in, light of policies already considered) [4 The significance of this lack of recorded evidence of prosecutions is said to make the presentation of appellants' rights too remote, too contingent, too hypothetical for adjudication in the light of the policies already considered.]

(they, must acquire, their learning) [Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint . . . ." Thus, for instance, when in that case and in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 , the Court struck down laws which sought not to require what children must learn in schools, but to prescribe, in the first case, what they must not learn, and in the second, where they must acquire their learning, I do not think it was wrong to put those decisions on "the right of the individual to . . . establish a home and bring up children," Meyer v. Nebraska, ibid., or on the basis that "The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction [367 U.S. 497, 544] � from public teachers only," Pierce v. Society of Sisters, at 535.]

Carolene Prods., 304 U.S. 144, 152 -153, which have led to their present status in the compendious notion of "liberty" embraced in the Fourteenth Amendment.]
