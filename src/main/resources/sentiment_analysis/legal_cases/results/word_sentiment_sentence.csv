case , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , The Court vacated and remanded petitioner's case in light of Johnson.
it , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , (a) The Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from "taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement."
at , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Johnson, supra, at ___-___.
root , Positive , criminal/case_1.txt , (1) The limited scope of the void-for-vagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing.
Congress , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Congress has long permitted district courts "wide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long."
Booker , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Yet this Court has "never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range," United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 233, nor suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range, even when that discretion is unfettered, see Batchelder, supra, at 123, 126.
rather , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Rather, they advise sentencing courts how to exercise their discretion within the bounds established by Congress.
s , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , (b) The holding in this case does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny, see, e.g., Peugh v. United States, 569 U.

S. ___, or render "sentencing procedure[s]" entirely "immune from scrutiny under the due process clause," Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 252, n. 18.
c , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , (c) Nor does this holding cast doubt on the validity of the other factors that sentencing courts must consider in exercising their sentencing discretion.
more , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , It is far from obvious that §4B1.2(a)'s residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness more than the other factors do, and neither the Guidelines nor the other factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.

begin , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , The clause beginning with "or otherwise" in this definition is known as the residual clause.
September , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , In September 2010, petitioner filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U. S. C. §2255, arguing that his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm was not a "crime of violence," and therefore that he did not qualify as a career offender under the Guidelines.
d , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , While his petition was pending, the Court decided Johnson, holding that "imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the [ACCA]"--which contained the same language as the Guidelines' residual clause--"violate[d] the Constitution's guarantee of due process" because the clause was unconstitutionally vague.
Constitution , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , While his petition was pending, the Court decided Johnson, holding that "imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the [ACCA]"--which contained the same language as the Guidelines' residual clause--"violate[d] the Constitution's guarantee of due process" because the clause was unconstitutionally vague.

S. 114, 123 (1979)), must specify the range of available sentences with "sufficient clarity," id., at 123; see also United States v. Evans, 333 U. S. 483 (1948); cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399 (1966).

Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399 (1966).

t , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , As we held in Irizarry v. United States, 555 U. S. 708 (2008), "[t]he due process concerns that . . . require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer" apply.
act , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Laws that "regulate persons or entities," we have explained, must be sufficiently clear "that those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way."
Fox , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U. S. 239, 253 (2012); see also Grayned, supra, at 108-109 ("A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters" to judges "for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis").

Burke , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Williams, 337 U. S., at 252, n. 18; see, e.g., Townsend v. Burke, 334 U. S. 736, 741 (1948) (holding that due process is violated when a court relies on "extensively and materially false" evidence to impose a sentence on an uncounseled defendant).
number , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , In addition to directing sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines, see §3553(a)(4)(A), Congress has directed them to consider a number of other factors in exercising their sentencing discretion, see §§3553(a)(1)-(3), (5)-(7).
hard , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , If petitioner were correct that §4B1.2(a)'s residual clause were subject to a vagueness challenge, we would be hard pressed to find these factors sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement.
holder , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 18-19 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted) (rejecting vagueness challenge to terrorism material-support statute, 18 U. S. C. §2339B).
little , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , We spent little time on whether the vagueness doctrine applied to such provisions.
good , Positive , criminal/case_1.txt , And for good reason: A statute fixing a sentence imposes no less a deprivation of liberty than does a statute defining a crime, as our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence makes plain.
ine , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , We instead analyzed the residual clause in light of "[n]ine years' experience trying to derive meaning from" it, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), and declared the experiment a failure.

man , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , We rejected the argument, explaining that such rules "call[ed] for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct; 'the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly . . . some matter of degree.' "
fate , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , We rejected the argument, explaining that such rules "call[ed] for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct; 'the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly . . . some matter of degree.' "
Nash , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , (quoting Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377 (1913)).
bear , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , The sentencing factors described by the majority bear no similarity to the categorical risk analysis that the Court held unconstitutionally vague in Johnson, nor to any other statutes it has previously found vague.
Cincinnati , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 615-616 (1971); United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89 (1921).5 And to the extent that the majority's concern is that subjecting sentencing factors to the Due Process Clause's prohibition on vagueness would risk the demise of discretionary sentencing regimes, that prospect is unlikely, for the reasons I have already explained.
Cohen , Neutral , criminal/case_1.txt , See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 615-616 (1971); United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.

Green , Neutral , criminal/case_2.txt , The Government is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause from challenging the acquittal, see Green v. United States, 355 U.

Dunn , Neutral , criminal/case_2.txt , Powell's starting point was our holding in Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390 (1932), that a criminal defendant may not attack a jury's finding of guilt on one count as inconsistent with the jury's verdict of acquittal on another count.
Hung , Neutral , criminal/case_2.txt , Hung counts, we therefore held, "ha[ve] no place in the issue-preclusion analysis," id., at 122: When a jury acquits on one count while failing to reach a verdict on another count concerning the same issue of ultimate fact, the acquittal, and only the acquittal, counts for preclusion purposes.
