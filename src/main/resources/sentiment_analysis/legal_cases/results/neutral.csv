practically, crawled_triples/127.txt, my Brother DOUGLAS, demonstrates, post at 597-598 practically unenforceable , Still, the Court hardly makes this clear, and ends up deferring to the discretion of prison officials to the extent that the right recognized is, as my Brother DOUGLAS demonstrates, post, at 597-598, practically unenforceable

unwarranted, crawled_triples/127.txt, unwarranted denial, giving deference to, judgment of prison officials , And, again, I would make it clear that the unwarranted denial of the right to confront adverse witnesses, after giving due deference to the judgment of prison officials and their reasonable concerns with inmate safety and institutional order, would be cause for judicial intervention

harmless, crawled_triples/128.txt, appellant 's advertising, may, may have harmless , Rather, the State's position is that although appellant's advertising may itself have been harmless - may even have had the salutary effect of informing some persons of rights of which they would otherwise have been unaware - the State's prohibition on the use of legal advice and information in advertising by attorneys is a prophylactic rule that is needed to ensure that attorneys, in an effort to secure legal business for themselves, do not use false or misleading advertising to stir up meritless litigation against innocent defendants

consumer, crawled_triples/128.txt, consumer, on, assumptions about qualities of product , Indeed, because it is probably rare that decisions regarding consumption of legal services are based on a consumer's assumptions about qualities of the product that can be represented visually, illustrations in lawyer's advertisements will probably be less likely to lend themselves to material misrepresentations than illustrations in other forms of advertising
tantamount, crawled_triples/128.txt, acceptance, would, Thus would tantamount , Thus, acceptance of the State's argument would be tantamount to adoption of the principle that a State may prohibit the use of pictures or illustrations in connection with advertising of any product or service simply on the strength of the general argument that the visual content of advertisements may, under some circumstances, be deceptive or manipulative

stricken, crawled_triples/128.txt, attorney, stricken from, rolls , Because "[a] relevant inquiry in appraising a decision to disbar is whether the attorney stricken from the rolls can be deemed to have been on notice that the courts would condemn the conduct for which he was removed," In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 554 (1968) (WHITE, J., concurring in result), it may well be that for Ohio actually to disbar an attorney on the basis of its disclosure requirements as they have been worked out to this point would raise significant due process concerns

unfamiliarity, crawled_triples/128.txt, general public, given, unfamiliarity with distinction between fees , I agree with the Court's conclusion that, given the general public's unfamiliarity with the distinction between fees and costs, a State may require an advertising attorney to include a costs disclaimer so as to avoid the potential for misunderstanding, ante, at 653 - provided the required disclaimer is "no broader than reasonably necessary to prevent the deception," In re R. M. J., supra, at 203
voluminous, crawled_triples/128.txt, voluminous record, reveal, instance , Yet an attorney's failure to specify a particular percentage rate when advertising that he accepts cases on a contingent-fee basis can in no way be said to be "inherently likely to deceive," id., at 202, and the voluminous record in this case fails to reveal a single instance suggesting that such a failure has in actual experience proved deceptive
ethically, crawled_triples/128.txt, it, be, ethically objectionable , In light of the ambiguity of the rules, Zauderer contracted the governing authorities before publishing the advertisement and unsuccessfully sought to determine whether it would be ethically objectionable
guess, crawled_triples/128.txt, men, guess at, its meaning , A regulation that "either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.

integration, crawled_triples/132.txt, separation, contemplates, integration , In keeping with Justice Jackson's Youngstown admonition that the separation of powers contemplates the integration of dispersed powers into a workable Government, we have recognized the constitutionality of a "twilight area" in which the activities of the separate Branches merge
auxiliary, crawled_triples/132.txt, Congress, vested in, auxiliary bodies , Our approach to other nonadjudicatory activities that Congress has vested either in federal courts or in auxiliary bodies within the Judicial Branch has been identical to our approach to judicial rulemaking: consistent with the separation of powers, Congress may delegate to the Judicial Branch nonadjudicatory functions that do not trench upon the prerogatives of another Branch and that are appropriate to the central mission of the Judiciary

conscript, crawled_triples/132.txt, its requirement, unconstitutionally conscripts, individual judges for service , Petitioner urges us to strike down the Act on the ground that its requirement of judicial participation on the Commission unconstitutionally conscripts individual federal judges for political service and thereby undermines the essential impartiality of the Judicial Branch

calculus, crawled_triples/132.txt, calculus, considering, nonadjudicatory activities performed , We note, however, that the constitutional calculus is different for considering nonadjudicatory activities performed by bodies that exercise judicial power and enjoy the constitutionally mandated autonomy of courts from what it is for considering the nonadjudicatory activities of independent nonadjudicatory agencies that Congress merely has located within the Judicial Branch pursuant to its powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause
ethic, crawled_triples/132.txt, we, considered, constitutionality of functions assigned to Division court created by Ethics in Government Act of 1978 , In this sense, the issue we face here is different from the issue we faced in Morrison v.

multifarious, crawled_triples/132.txt, factors, are, multifarious , Since Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we are, and better equipped to inform itself of the "necessities" of government; and since the factors bearing upon those necessities are both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan sense) highly political - including, for example, whether the Nation is at war, see Yakus v.

appraise, crawled_triples/135.txt, other, appraise conduct as, implicit in concept of liberty , It is to be applied, according to this view, to facts and circumstances as they arise, the cases falling on one side of the line or the other as a majority of nine justices appraise conduct as either implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or as lying without the confines of that vague concept

boy, crawled_triples/135.txt, boy, read, story , Since death and damnation might be, according to his belief, the portion of the girl or boy who read a ribald story, it is easy to understand why he was so impatient with those who advanced the claims of art
damnation, crawled_triples/135.txt, portion, is easy, damnation might be , Since death and damnation might be, according to his belief, the portion of the girl or boy who read a ribald story, it is easy to understand why he was so impatient with those who advanced the claims of art

regrettably, crawled_triples/135.txt, adequate exposition, Regrettably calls for, dissenting opinion , Regrettably, an adequate exposition of my views calls for a dissenting opinion of unusual length
married, crawled_triples/135.txt, such laws, relate to, use of contraceptives by married persons , Between them these suits seek declaratory relief against the threatened enforcement of Connecticut's antibirthcontrol laws making criminal the use of contraceptives, insofar as such laws relate to the use of contraceptives by married persons and the giving of advice to married persons in their use
plurality, crawled_triples/135.txt, reliance, be, placed by plurality in instance , Since all of them are referred to here in one way or another, it is well to proceed to a disclosure of those which are not involved in the present appeals, thereby focusing attention on the one factor on which reliance appears to be placed by both the plurality and concurring opinions in this instance
apposite, crawled_triples/135.txt, apposite, is in, present cases , Hence, any language in the cases where the Court has abstained from exercising its jurisdiction, to the effect that we should not "entertain constitutional questions in advance of the strictest necessity," Parker v. Los Angeles County, supra, at 333, is not at all apposite in the present cases
contingency, crawled_triples/135.txt, need, contingency of, application , In all of those cases the lack of ripeness inhered in the fact that the need for some further procedure, some further contingency of application or interpretation, whether judicial, administrative or executive, or some further clarification of the intentions of the claimant, served to make remote the issue which was sought to be presented to the Court
catchall, crawled_triples/135.txt, it, become, catchall for discretion on part decline , But this doctrine in turn needs further particularization lest it become a catchall for an unarticulated discretion on the part of this Court to decline to adjudicate appeals involving Constitutional issues
renounce, crawled_triples/135.txt, Connecticut, renounced, that , The plurality opinion now finds, and the concurring opinion must assume, that the only explanation of the absence of recorded prosecutions subsequent to the Nelson case is that Connecticut has renounced that intention to prosecute and punish "any person . . . in accordance with the literal provisions of the law" which it announced in Nelson
renunciation, crawled_triples/135.txt, renunciation, is consistent with, lack of subsequent prosecutions , But if renunciation of the purposes of the Nelson prosecution is consistent with a lack of subsequent prosecutions, success of that purpose is no less consistent with this lack
unwillingness, crawled_triples/135.txt, State, on, supposed unwillingness prosecute , I find it difficult to believe that doctors generally - and not just those operating specialized clinics - would continue openly to disseminate advice about contraceptives after Nelson in reliance on the State's supposed unwillingness to prosecute, or to consider that high-minded members of the profession would in consequence of such inaction deem themselves warranted in disrespecting this law so long as it is on the books
rid, crawled_triples/135.txt, Court, indulged, rid of case , 7 In short, I fear that the Court has indulged in a bit of sleight of hand to be rid of this case
absolve, crawled_triples/135.txt, law, absolves, us , What must be relied on, therefore, is that the historical absence of prosecutions in some way leaves these appellants free to violate the statute without fear of prosecution, whether or not the law is Constitutional, and thus absolves us from the duty of deciding if it is
revert, crawled_triples/135.txt, we, revert again to, reasons , If we revert again to the reasons underlying our reluctance to exercise a jurisdiction which technically we possess, and the concrete expression of those underlying reasons in our cases, see pp. 526-531, supra, then I think it must become clear that there is no justification for failing to decide these married persons' appeals
fairest, crawled_triples/135.txt, fairest possible procedure, is in, application to individuals , Were due process merely a procedural safeguard it would fail to reach those situations where the deprivation of life, liberty or property was accomplished by legislation which by operating in the future could, given even the fairest possible procedure in application to individuals, nevertheless destroy the enjoyment of all three
discrete, crawled_triples/135.txt, process, is, discrete , Indeed the fact that an identical provision limiting federal action is found among the first eight Amendments, applying to the Federal Government, suggests that due process is a discrete concept which subsists as an independent guaranty of liberty and procedural fairness, more general and inclusive than the specific prohibitions
dissolute, crawled_triples/135.txt, availability, minimize, consequence of dissolute action , The State, on the other hand, asserts that it is acting to protect the moral welfare of its citizenry, both directly, in that it considers the practice of contraception immoral in itself, and instrumentally, in that the availability of contraceptive materials tends to minimize "the disastrous consequence of dissolute action," that is fornication and adultery
soundness, crawled_triples/135.txt, society, traditionally concerned with, soundness of its people , Yet the very inclusion of the category of morality among state concerns indicates that society is not limited in its objects only to the physical well-being of the community, [367 U.S. 497, 546] � but has traditionally concerned itself with the moral soundness of its people as well
sexuality, crawled_triples/135.txt, powers, confining, sexuality , The laws regarding marriage which provide both when the sexual powers may be used and the legal and societal context in which children are born and brought up, as well as laws forbidding adultery, fornication and homosexual practices which express the negative of the proposition, confining sexuality to lawful marriage, form a pattern so deeply pressed into the substance of our social life that any Constitutional doctrine in this area must build upon that basis
marriage, crawled_triples/135.txt, sexual powers, confining sexuality to, lawful marriage , The laws regarding marriage which provide both when the sexual powers may be used and the legal and societal context in which children are born and brought up, as well as laws forbidding adultery, fornication and homosexual practices which express the negative of the proposition, confining sexuality to lawful marriage, form a pattern so deeply pressed into the substance of our social life that any Constitutional doctrine in this area must build upon that basis
swallow, crawled_triples/135.txt, We, swallowing, camel , We would indeed be straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel were we to show concern for the niceties of property law involved in our recent decision, under the Fourth Amendment, in Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610 , and yet fail at least to see any substantial claim here
intimacy, crawled_triples/135.txt, intimacy, is, essential , Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids altogether, but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected
iniquitous, crawled_triples/135.txt, use, is iniquitous as, act of extra-marital sexual immorality , In sum, even though the State has determined that the use of contraceptives is as iniquitous as any act of extra-marital sexual immorality, the intrusion of the whole machinery of the criminal law into the very heart of marital privacy, requiring husband and wife to render account before a criminal tribunal of their uses of that intimacy, is surely a very different thing indeed from punishing those who establish intimacies which the law has always forbidden and which can have no claim to social protection
supposition, crawled_triples/135.txt, support, be drawn for, supposition , [ Footnote 4 ] Some support is sought to be drawn for the supposition of state acquiescence in violation of the statute from the case of State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials, 126 Conn. 428, 11 A. 2d 863

conserve, crawled_triples/136.txt, summary adjudication, conserves time, accepted without challenge , Since most terminations are accepted without challenge, summary adjudication also conserves both the fisc and administrative time and energy by reducing the number of evidentiary hearings actually held
cogent, crawled_triples/136.txt, itself, is, cogent evidence , Indeed, the very provision for a post-termination evidentiary hearing in New York's Home Relief program is itself cogent evidence that the State recognizes the primacy of the public interest in correct eligibility determinations and therefore in the provision of procedural safeguards
primacy, crawled_triples/136.txt, State, recognizes, primacy of interest in eligibility determinations , Indeed, the very provision for a post-termination evidentiary hearing in New York's Home Relief program is itself cogent evidence that the State recognizes the primacy of the public interest in correct eligibility determinations and therefore in the provision of procedural safeguards
rebuttal, crawled_triples/136.txt, he, produce evidence in, rebuttal , As the District Court correctly concluded, "[t]he stakes are simply too high for the welfare recipient, and the possibility for honest error or irritable misjudgment too great, to allow termination of aid without giving the recipient a chance, if he so desires, to be fully informed of the case against him so that he may contest its basis and produce evidence in rebuttal.
caseload, crawled_triples/136.txt, welfare departments, have, burdensome caseloads , We recognize, too, that both welfare authorities and recipients have an interest in relatively speedy resolution of questions of eligibility, that they are used to dealing with one another informally, and that some welfare departments have very burdensome caseloads
veracity, crawled_triples/136.txt, veracity, are at, issue , Particularly where credibility and veracity are at issue, as they must be in many termination proceedings, written submissions are a wholly unsatisfactory basis for decision

coincide, crawled_triples/136.txt, amendment, is in, April of Regulation 351.26 coincided with , [ Footnote 3 ] The adoption in February 1968 and the amendment in April of Regulation 351.26 coincided with or followed several revisions by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of its regulations implementing 42 U.S.C. 602 (a) (4), which is the provision of the Social Security Act that requires a State to afford a "fair hearing" to any recipient of aid under a federally assisted program before termination of his aid becomes final
notification, crawled_triples/136.txt, subdivision, requires notification at_time, at least seven days prior to proposed date of reasons for discontinuance , That subdivision also requires written notification to the recipient at least seven days prior to the proposed effective date of the reasons for the proposed discontinuance or suspension

McElroy, supra, at 896, summary dismissal of a public employee was upheld [397 U.S. 254, 264] � because "[i]n [its] proprietary military capacity, the Federal Government . . . has traditionally exercised unfettered control," and because the case involved the Government's "dispatch of its own internal affairs.

fortunate, crawled_triples/138.txt, she, return, more fortunate , Ms. Skilbred averred that she traveled to Sri Lanka in 1981 and "observed th[e] habitat" of "endangered species such as the Asian elephant and the leopard" at what is now the site of the Mahaweli project funded by the Agency for International Development (AID), although she "was unable to see any of the endangered species"; "this development project," she continued, will seriously reduce endangered, threatened, and endemic species habitat including areas that I visited . . . [, which] may severely shorten the future of these species"; that threat, she concluded, harmed her because she "intend[s] to return to Sri Lanka in the future and hope[s] to be more fortunate in spotting at least the endangered elephant and leopard.

elephant, crawled_triples/138.txt, Asian elephants, is in, Bronx Zoo , Under these theories, anyone who goes to see Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, and anyone who is a keeper of Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, has standing to sue because the Director of Agency for International Development did not consult with the Secretary regarding the AID-funded project in Sri Lanka

funding, crawled_triples/138.txt, redress, requires, action by individual funding agencies , 5 The [504 U.S. 555, 571] � short of the matter is that redress of the only injury in fact respondents complain of requires action (termination of funding until consultation) by the individual funding agencies; and any relief the District Court could have provided in this suit against the Secretary was not likely to produce that action
consultative, crawled_triples/138.txt, other official, follow, assertedly correct consultative procedure , The court held that, because 7(a)(2) requires interagency consultation, the citizen-suit provision creates a "procedural righ[t]" to consultation in all "persons" - so that anyone can file suit in federal court to challenge the Secretary's (or presumably any other official's) failure to follow the assertedly correct consultative procedure, notwithstanding his or her inability to allege any discrete injury flowing from that failure
site, crawled_triples/138.txt, Skilbred, soon return to, project sites , [ Footnote 2 ] The dissent acknowledges the settled requirement that the injury complained of be, if not actual, then at least imminent, but it contends that respondents could get past summary judgment because "a reasonable finder of fact could conclude . . . that . . . Kelly or Skilbred will soon return to the project sites.
imminence, crawled_triples/138.txt, imminence, is, concept , Although "imminence" is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes - that the injury is "`"certainly impending,"'" id., at 158 (emphasis added)
elastic, crawled_triples/138.txt, imminence, is, concededly elastic concept , Although "imminence" is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes - that the injury is "`"certainly impending,"'" id., at 158 (emphasis added)
posit, crawled_triples/138.txt, others, posited by, dissent , That case and the others posited by the dissent all involve actual harm; the existence of standing is clear, though the precise extent of harm remains to be determined at trial
location, crawled_triples/138.txt, location, mitigates, harm , [ Footnote 3 ] The dissent embraces each of respondents' "nexus" theories, rejecting this portion of our analysis because it is "unable to see how the distant location of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling at summary judgment) mitigates the harm" to the plaintiff
mitigate, crawled_triples/138.txt, location, mitigates, harm , [ Footnote 3 ] The dissent embraces each of respondents' "nexus" theories, rejecting this portion of our analysis because it is "unable to see how the distant location of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling at summary judgment) mitigates the harm" to the plaintiff
remoteness, crawled_triples/138.txt, such finding, geographic remoteness of, here United States , The dissent may be correct that the geographic remoteness of those members (here in the United States) from Sri Lanka and Aswan does not "necessarily" prevent such a finding - but it assuredly does so when no further facts have been brought forward (and respondents have produced none) showing that the impact upon animals in those distant places will in some fashion be reflected here
craftsman, crawled_triples/138.txt, he, is, craftsman , JUSTICE BLACKMUN's accusation that a special rule is being crafted for "environmental claims," post, at 6, is correct, but he is the craftsman
rejoinder, crawled_triples/138.txt, dissent, has, rejoinder , The dissent's rejoinder that redressability was clear at the outset because the Secretary thought the regulation binding on the agencies, post, at 9-10, n. 4, continues to miss the point: The agencies did not agree with the Secretary, nor would they be bound by a district court holding (as to this issue) in the Secretary's favor
preexist, crawled_triples/138.txt, defendant, point out, preexisting standing defect , And permitting a defendant to point out a preexisting standing defect late in the day is not remotely comparable to permitting a plaintiff to establish standing on the basis of the defendant's litigation conduct occurring after standing is erroneously determined
commencement, crawled_triples/138.txt, standing, be determined as of, commencement of suit , Since, as we have pointed out above, standing [504 U.S. 555, 571] � is to be determined as of the commencement of suit, since at that point it could certainly not be known that the suit would reach this Court and since it is not likely that an agency would feel compelled to accede to the legal view of a district court expressed in a case to which it was not a party, redressability clearly did not exist
licensed, crawled_triples/138.txt, one living, adjacent to, site for proposed construction of federally licensed dam , Thus, under our case law, one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency's failure to prepare an environmental impact statement, even though he cannot establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered, and even though the dam will not be completed for many years

adversarial, crawled_triples/138.txt, It, preserves, vitality of adversarial process , It preserves the vitality of the adversarial process by assuring both that the parties before the court have an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome, and that the legal questions presented . . . will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action

esthetic, crawled_triples/138.txt, individuals, are motivated by, esthetic enjoyment , Given that finding, we have no license to demean the importance of the interest that particular individuals may have in observing any species or its habitat, whether those individuals are motivated by esthetic enjoyment, an interest in professional research, or an economic interest in preservation of the species
timing, crawled_triples/138.txt, imminence, should, In my judgment should measured by timing of threatened environmental harm , In my judgment, [504 U.S. 555, 583] � therefore, the "imminence" of such an injury should be measured by the timing and likelihood of the threatened environmental harm, rather than - as the Court seems to suggest, ante, at 8-9, and n. 2 - by the time that might elapse between the present and the time when the individuals would visit the area if no such injury should occur
opine, crawled_triples/138.txt, plurality, opines, even respondents succeed , But, the plurality opines, even if respondents succeed and a new regulation is [504 U.S. 555, 585] � promulgated, there is no guarantee that federal agencies that are not parties to this case will actually consult with the Secretary
superfluous, crawled_triples/138.txt, proof, might, might superfluous , Thus, if the facts of this case had shown repeated and regular visits by the respondents, cf. ante, at 1-2 (Opinion of KENNEDY J.), proof of an intent to revisit might well be superfluous

vastly, crawled_triples/138.txt, Congress, give, vastly different scope , I cannot subscribe to the Court of Appeals' strained interpretation, for there is no indication that Congress intended to give such vastly different scope to the two clauses in 7(a)(2)
indicative, crawled_triples/138.txt, Court, read findings as, indicative of intent make , The Court of Appeals read these findings as indicative of a congressional intent to make 7(a)(2)'s consultation requirement applicable to agency action abroad

Lyons, 461 U.S., at 105 (harm dependent on police's arresting plaintiff again [504 U.S. 555, 593] � and subjecting him to chokehold); Rizzo v.

resurrect, crawled_triples/138.txt, it, likely will resurrect code as, courts , More likely, it will resurrect a code pleading formalism in federal court summary judgment practice, as federal courts, newly doubting their jurisdiction, will demand more and more particularized showings of future harm
consortium, crawled_triples/138.txt, alleging, loss of, consortium , And a Federal Tort Claims Act plaintiff alleging loss of consortium should make sure to furnish this Court with a "description of concrete plans" for her nightly schedule of attempted activities
ecosystem, crawled_triples/138.txt, injury, lacking, respondents ' allegations of ecosystem nexus failed , The Court also concludes that injury is lacking, because respondents' allegations of "ecosystem nexus" failed to demonstrate sufficient proximity to the site of the environmental harm
eradication, crawled_triples/138.txt, his government 's participation, is in, eradication of Asian elephants , The Court says that it is "beyond all reason" that a zoo "keeper" of Asian elephants would have standing to contest his government's participation in the eradication of all the Asian elephants in another part of the world
keeper, crawled_triples/138.txt, distant location, necessarily mitigates harm to, elephant keeper , I am unable to see how the distant location of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling [504 U.S. 555, 595] � at summary judgment) mitigates the harm to the elephant keeper
formalism, crawled_triples/138.txt, Court, applying, its rigid principles of geographic formalism , I have difficulty imagining this Court applying its rigid principles of geographic formalism anywhere outside the context of environmental claims

engineering, crawled_triples/138.txt, wildlife problems, receive level as, engineering project , If wildlife problems receive the same level of attention as the engineering project, then the negative impacts to the environment can be alleviated
lawlessness, crawled_triples/138.txt, it, is on, its invitation of executive lawlessness , I find myself unable to agree with the plurality's analysis of redressability, based as it is on its invitation of executive lawlessness, ignorance of principles of collateral estoppel, unfounded assumptions about causation, and erroneous conclusions about what the record does not say

relax, crawled_triples/138.txt, Court, Ironically has previously justified, relaxed review of congressional delegation to Executive , Ironically, this Court has previously justified a relaxed review of congressional delegation to the Executive on grounds that Congress, in turn, has subjected the exercise of that power to judicial review

enmesh, crawled_triples/138.txt, classes, are, so enmeshed , It is to be hoped that, over time, the Court will acknowledge that some classes of procedural duties are so enmeshed with the prevention of a substantive, concrete harm that an individual plaintiff may be able to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of injury just through the breach of that procedural duty
inception, crawled_triples/138.txt, participation, arose after, its inception , [ Footnote 4 ] The plurality now suggests that collateral estoppel principles can have no application here, because the participation of other agencies in this litigation arose after its inception
borrowing, crawled_triples/138.txt, Court, Borrowing, principle , Borrowing a principle from this Court's statutory diversity jurisdiction cases and transferring it to the constitutional standing context, the Court observes: "`The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed'"

eagerness, crawled_triples/139.txt, other, with, arguments with utmost eagerness of reasoning , The result was that, during the period in question, the examination of the prisoner, which is at present scupulously and I think even pedantically avoided, was the very essence of the trial, and his answers regulated the production of the evidence; the whole trial, in fact, was a long argument between the prisoner and counsel for the Crown, in which they questioned each other and grappled with each other's arguments with the utmost eagerness and closeness of reasoning.
confirmation, crawled_triples/139.txt, curious confirmation, is in, report of trial , This description of the questioning of the accused and the meeting of contending arguments finds curious confirmation in the report of the trial, in 1637, of Ann Hutchinson (which resulted in banishment) for holding and encouraging certain theological views which were not approved by the majority of the early Massachusetts rulers

birthright, crawled_triples/139.txt, their birthright, laws of, England , An able writer on English and American constitutional [211 U.S. 78, 119] � law has recently well said: 'When the first Continental Congres of 1774 claimed to be entitled to the benefit, not only of the common law of England, but of such of the English statutes as existed at the time of the colonization, and which they had by experience found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances, they simply declared the basic principle of English law that English subjects, going to a new and uninhabited country, carry with them, as their birthright, the laws of England existing when the colonization takes place. . . 
formation, crawled_triples/139.txt, immunity, was privilege at, time of formation , Can such a view be deemed unreasonable in the face of the fact, frankly conceded in the opinion of the court, that, at common law, as well at the time of the formation of the Union and when the 14th Amendment was adopted, immunity from self-incrimination was a privilege 'universal in American law,' was everywhere deemed 'of great value, a protection to the innocent, though a shelter to the guilty, and a safeguard against heedless, unfounded, or tyrannical prosecutions?
interweave, crawled_triples/139.txt, priceless character, of privilege is, one thoroughly interwoven with history , Is it conceivable that a privilege or immunity of such a priceless character, one expressly recognized in the supreme law of the land, one thoroughly interwoven with the history of Anglo-American liberty, was not in the mind of the country when it declared, in the 14th Amendment, that no state shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States

expedition, crawled_triples/145.txt, expedition, is in, administration of criminal law , "consistently held that the necessity for expedition in the administration of the criminal law justifies putting one who seeks to resist the production of desired information to a choice between compliance with a trial court's order to produce prior to any review of that order, and resistance to that order with the concomitant possibility of an adjudication of contempt if his claims are rejected on appeal.

extinguish, crawled_triples/146.txt, defendant, chose, extinguish , This misreading of precedent in Booth has, we think, unfairly weighted the scales in a capital trial; while virtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances, the State is barred from either offering "a quick glimpse of the life" which a defendant "chose to extinguish," Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 397 (1988) (REHNQUIST, C.J., dissenting), or demonstrating the loss to the victim's family and to society which has resulted from the defendant's homicide

Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 397 (1988) [501 U.S. 808, 831] � (REHNQUIST, C.J., dissenting), to remind the jury that the person whose life was taken was a unique human being
faceless, crawled_triples/146.txt, murder victim, faceless stranger at, penalty phase of capital trial , Certainly there is no strong societal consensus that a jury may not take into account the loss suffered by a victim's family or that a murder victim must remain a faceless stranger at the penalty phase of a capital trial
infect, crawled_triples/146.txt, witness testimony, infects sentencing proceeding in, particular case , If, in a particular case, a witness' testimony or a prosecutor's remark so infects the sentencing proceeding as to render it fundamentally unfair, the defendant may seek appropriate relief under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
bleed, crawled_triples/146.txt, Charisse Christopher, bled to, death , But surely this brief statement did not inflame their passions more than did the facts of the crime: Charisse Christopher was stabbed 41 times with a butcher knife and bled to death; her 2-year-old daughter Lacie was killed by repeated thrusts of that same knife; and 3-year-old Nicholas, despite stab wounds that penetrated completely through his body from front to back, survived - only to witness the brutal murders of his mother and baby sister
familiarity, crawled_triples/146.txt, jury, of, unavoidable familiarity with facts of vicious attack , In light of the jury's unavoidable familiarity with the facts of Payne's vicious attack, I cannot conclude that the additional information provided by Mary Zvolanek's testimony deprived petitioner of due process
lifeless, crawled_triples/146.txt, Charisse, were, more than just lifeless bodies on videotape , In arguing that Payne deserved the death penalty, the prosecutor sought to remind the jury that Charisse and Lacie were more than just lifeless bodies on a videotape, that they were unique human beings
survivor, crawled_triples/146.txt, victim, on, survivors , I join the Court's opinion addressing two categories of facts excluded from consideration at capital sentencing proceedings by Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U.S. 805 (1989): information revealing the individuality of the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim's survivors
individuality, crawled_triples/146.txt, individuality, impact of, crime , I join the Court's opinion addressing two categories of facts excluded from consideration at capital sentencing proceedings by Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U.S. 805 (1989): information revealing the individuality of the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim's survivors
categorize, crawled_triples/146.txt, criminal conduct, been, categorized differently , Indeed, as the Court's opinion today, see ante, at 819-821, and dissents in Booth, supra, at 519-520 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) and Gathers, supra, at 817-820 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), make clear, criminal conduct has traditionally been categorized and penalized differently according to consequences not specifically [501 U.S. 808, 836] � intended, but determined in part by conditions unknown to a defendant when he acted
foreseeable, crawled_triples/146.txt, it, considering, range of foreseeable consequences , One such fact that is known to all murderers and relevant to the blameworthiness of each one was identified by the Booth majority itself when it barred the sentencing authority in capital cases from considering "the full range of foreseeable consequences of a defendant's actions.
homicidal, crawled_triples/146.txt, he, will take by, his homicidal behavior , Every defendant knows, if endowed with the mental competence for criminal responsibility, that the life he will take by his homicidal behavior is that of a unique person, like himself, and that the person to be killed probably has close associates, "survivors," who will suffer harms and deprivations from the victim's death
imbue, crawled_triples/146.txt, foreseeability, imbues, them , That foreseeability of the killing's consequences imbues them with direct moral relevance, cf. Penry v. Lynaugh, supra, at 328 (death penalty should be "`reasoned moral response'"), and evidence of the specific harm caused when a homicidal risk is realized is nothing more than evidence of the risk that the defendant originally chose to run despite the [501 U.S. 808, 839] � kinds of consequences that were obviously foreseeable
defensible, crawled_triples/146.txt, It, is, defensible , It is morally both defensible and appropriate to consider such evidence when penalizing a murderer, like other criminals, in light of common knowledge and the moral responsibility that such knowledge entails
individualize, crawled_triples/146.txt, case, from, promise of appropriately individualized sentencing for capital defendants , I must rely as well on my further view that Booth sets an unworkable standard of constitutional relevance that threatens, on its own terms, to produce such arbitrary consequences and uncertainty of application as virtually to guarantee a result far diminished from the case's promise of appropriately [501 U.S. 808, 840] � individualized sentencing for capital defendants
systematically, crawled_triples/146.txt, Booth, was prompted by, introduction of systematically prepared victim impact statement at sentencing phase , First, although Booth was prompted by the introduction of a systematically prepared "victim impact statement" at the sentencing phase of the trial, Booth's restriction of relevant facts to what the defendant knew and considered in deciding to kill applies to any evidence, however derived or presented
widow, crawled_triples/146.txt, widow, deceive jury about, her relationship , This is so not only because the widow will not try to deceive the jury about her relationship, but also because the usual standards of trial relevance afford factfinders enough information about [501 U.S. 808, 841] � surrounding circumstances to let them make sense of the narrowly material facts of the crime itself
comprehensibility, crawled_triples/146.txt, we, would reduce, comprehensibility of trials , If we were to require the rules of guilt-phase evidence to be changed to guarantee the full effect of Booth's promise to exclude consideration of specific facts unknown to the defendant and thus supposedly without significance in morally evaluating his decision to kill, we would seriously reduce the comprehensibility of most trials by depriving jurors of those details of context that allow them to understand what is being described
rebuff, crawled_triples/146.txt, majority, rebuffed, attack upon ruling , By another 5-4 vote, a majority of this Court rebuffed an attack upon this ruling just two Terms ago
upheaval, crawled_triples/146.txt, Court 's precedents, even more extensive upheaval of be, store , In dispatching Booth and Gathers to their graves, today's majority ominously suggests that an even more extensive upheaval of this Court's precedents may be in store
stagger, crawled_triples/146.txt, implications, are, staggering , The implications of this radical new exception to the doctrine of stare decisis are staggering
signal, crawled_triples/146.txt, majority, sends signal at_time, today , The majority today sends a clear signal that scores of established constitutional liberties are now ripe for reconsideration, thereby inviting the very type of open defiance of our precedents that the majority rewards in this case
convincingly, crawled_triples/146.txt, argument, was convincingly answered, I show , Every one of the arguments made by the majority can be found in the dissenting opinions filed in those two cases, and, as I show in the margin, each argument was convincingly answered by Justice Powell and Justice Brennan
rehearse, crawled_triples/146.txt, one, reading, majority 's rehearsing , But contrary to the impression that one might receive from reading the majority's lengthy rehearsing of the issues addressed in Booth and Gathers, the outcome of this case does [501 U.S. 808, 848] � not turn simply on who - the Booth and Gathers majorities or the Booth and Gathers dissenters - had the better of the argument
coherence, crawled_triples/146.txt, particular precedent, become, detriment to coherence , Such justifications include the advent of "subsequent changes or development in the law" that undermine a decision's rationale, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, supra, at 173; the need "to bring [a decision] into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained," Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., supra, at 412 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); and a showing that a particular precedent has become a "detriment to coherence and consistency in the law," Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, supra, at 173
truncation, crawled_triples/146.txt, truncation, is, astonishing , This truncation of the Court's duty to stand by its own precedents is astonishing
debilitate, crawled_triples/146.txt, majority 's debilitated conception, Carried to, its conclusion , Carried to its logical conclusion, the majority's debilitated conception of stare decisis would destroy the Court's very capacity to resolve authoritatively the abiding conflicts between those with power and those without
applaud, crawled_triples/146.txt, majority, Far applauds, it , Far from condemning this blatant disregard for the rule of law, the majority applauds it
unremarkable, crawled_triples/146.txt, conflicts, is with, unremarkable observation , Nothing in Booth or Gathers, however, conflicts with this unremarkable observation
discount, crawled_triples/146.txt, majority, also discounts, Justice Powell 's concern with quality , The majority also discounts Justice Powell's concern with the inherently prejudicial quality of victim-impact evidence. 
tautology, crawled_triples/146.txt, tautology, Unsurprisingly is completely unresponsive to, Justice Powell 's argument , Unsurprisingly, this tautology is completely unresponsive to Justice Powell's argument
unresponsive, crawled_triples/146.txt, tautology, Unsurprisingly is completely unresponsive to, Justice Powell 's argument , Unsurprisingly, this tautology is completely unresponsive to Justice Powell's argument
brutality, crawled_triples/146.txt, death penalty, was, only punishment available in light of brutality , This finding was based on the court's conclusion that "the death penalty was the only rational punishment available" in light of the "inhuman brutality" evident in the circumstances of the murder
unheard, crawled_triples/146.txt, Victim impact evidence, was unheard, decided , "Victim impact" evidence was still unheard of when Lockett was decided
imbalanced, crawled_triples/146.txt, exclusion, results in, significantly imbalanced sentencing procedure , The conclusion that exclusion of victim impact evidence results in a significantly imbalanced sentencing procedure is simply inaccurate
parity, crawled_triples/146.txt, parity, is in, sentencing process , Even if balance were required or desirable, today's decision, by permitting both the defendant and the State to introduce irrelevant evidence for the sentencer's consideration without any guidance, surely does nothing to enhance parity in the sentencing process
scenario, crawled_triples/146.txt, defendants, could foresee In, scenario , In each scenario, the defendants could reasonably foresee that their acts might result in loss of human life
empanel, crawled_triples/146.txt, different jury, is, empaneled , He reasons that the ideal of basing sentencing determinations entirely on the moral culpability of the defendant is therefore unattainable unless a different jury is empaneled for the sentencing hearing
greet, crawled_triples/146.txt, today 's decision, be, greeted with enthusiasm by large number of citizens , Given the current popularity of capital punishment in a crime-ridden society, the political appeal of arguments that assume that increasing the severity of sentences is the best cure for the cancer of crime, and the political strength of the "victims' rights" movement, I recognize that today's decision will be greeted with enthusiasm by a large number of concerned and thoughtful citizens
hydraulic, crawled_triples/146.txt, hydraulic pressure, played, its decision , The great tragedy of the decision, however, is the danger that the "hydraulic pressure" of public opinion that Justice Holmes once described 3 - and that properly influences the deliberations of democratic legislatures - has played a role not only in the Court's decision to hear this case, 4 and in its decision to reach the constitutional question without pausing to consider affirming on the basis of the Tennessee Supreme Court's rationale, 5 but even in its resolution of the constitutional issue involved
outpour, crawled_triples/146.txt, outpouring, take, factors , "Recent years have seen an outpouring of popular concern for what has come to be known as `victims' rights' - a phrase that describes what its proponents feel is the failure of courts of justice to take into account in their sentencing decisions not only the factors mitigating the defendant's moral guilt, but also the amount of harm he has caused to innocent members of society
indorse, crawled_triples/147.txt, magistrate, indorse on, depositions , These require, among other things, that the testimony of the witnesses shall be reduced to writing in the form of depositions; and section 872 declares that if it appears from the examination that a public offense has been committed, and there is sufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty thereof, the magistrate must indorse on the depositions an order, signed by him, to that effect, describing the general nature of the offense committed, and ordering that the defendant be held to answer thereto
misunderstand, crawled_triples/147.txt, it, been, misunderstood , This passage from COKE seems to be the chief foundation of the opinion for which it is cited; but a critical examination and [110 U.S. 516, 523] � comparison of the text and context will show that it has been misunderstood; that it was not intended to assert that an indictment or presentment of a grand jury was essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used
suite, crawled_triples/147.txt, king, at, suite , He then proceeds to state that (3) no man shall be outlawed, unless according to the law of the land ; (4) no man shall be exiled, unless according to the law of the land; (5) no man shall be in any sort destroyed, 'unless it be by the verdict of his equals, or according to the law of the land;' (6) 'no man shall be condemned at the king's suite, either before the king in his bench, where the pleas are coram rege, (and so are the words nec super eum ibimus to be understood,) nor before any other commissioner or judge whatsoever, and so are the words nec super eum mittemus to be understood, but by the judgment of his peers, that is, equals, or according to the law of the land.

forensic, crawled_triples/147.txt, It, is forensic trial under, law , This view of the meaning of Lord COKE is the one taken by MERRICK, J., in his dissenting opinion in Jones Robbins, supra, who states his conclusions in these words: 'It is the forensic trial, under a broad and general law, operating equally upon every member of our community, which the words 'by the law of the land,' in Magna Charta, and in every subsequent declaration of rights which has borrowed its phraseology, make essential to the safety of the citizen, securing thereby both his liberty and his property, by preventing the unlawful arrest of his person, or any unlawful interference with his estate.
