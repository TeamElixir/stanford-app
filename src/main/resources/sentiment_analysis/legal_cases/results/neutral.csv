crux, crawled_triples/45.txt, We, thus come to, crux of case , We thus come to the crux of this case
hole, crawled_triples/45.txt, prosecution, take look at, its hole card , An objection on the spot may force the prosecution to take a hard look at its hole card, and even if the prosecutor thinks that the state trial judge will admit the evidence he must contemplate the possibility of reversal by the state appellate courts or the ultimate issuance of a federal writ of habeas corpus based on the impropriety of the state court's rejection of the federal constitutional claim
peer, crawled_triples/45.txt, him, be tried by, jury of his peers , A defendant has been accused of a serious crime, and this is the time and place set for him to be tried by a jury of his peers and found either guilty or not guilty by that jury

legitimacy, crawled_triples/45.txt, enforcement, lacking in, legitimacy , Because, the Court reasoned, the purposes of the contemporaneous-objection rule were largely served by the motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State's case, enforcement of the contemporaneous-objection rule was less than essential and therefore lacking in the necessary "legitimacy" to make it an adequate state ground
forgone, crawled_triples/45.txt, decisions, bar forgone, review , [ Footnote 14 ] In Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S., at 451 , the Court noted that decisions of counsel relating to trial strategy, even when made without the consultation of the defendant, would bar direct federal review of claims thereby forgone, except where "the circumstances are exceptional.

expertise, crawled_triples/45.txt, lawyer, actually exercis, his expertise , In an extraordinary modification of Fay, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN would now require "that the lawyer actually exercis[e] his expertise and judgment in his client's service, and with his client's knowing and intelligent participation where possible"; he does not intimate what guidelines would be used to decide when or under what circumstances this would actually be "possible.
unmanageable, crawled_triples/45.txt, vague standard, would, would unmanageable , This vague "standard" would be unmanageable to the point of impossibility
defensible, crawled_triples/45.txt, I, reject, illogical uprooting of otherwise defensible doctrine , I would leave the core holding of Fay where it began, and reject this illogical uprooting of an otherwise defensible doctrine
uproot, crawled_triples/45.txt, I, reject, uprooting , I would leave the core holding of Fay where it began, and reject this illogical uprooting of an otherwise defensible doctrine
unresolved, crawled_triples/45.txt, issue, remains, unresolved , Because this key issue remains unresolved, I shall attempt in this opinion a re-examination of the policies 2 that should [433 U.S. 72, 101] � inform - and in Fay did inform - the selection of the standard governing the availability of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction in the face of an intervening procedural default in the state court
inadvertence, crawled_triples/45.txt, default, is born of, inadvertence , In brief then, any realistic system of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction must be premised on the reality that the ordinary procedural default is born of the inadvertence, negligence, inexperience, or incompetence of trial counsel
airtight, crawled_triples/45.txt, interests, declining, react to defaults through creation of airtight system , I persist in the belief that the interests of Sykes and the State of Florida are best rationalized by adherence to this test, and by declining to react to inadvertent defaults through the creation of an "airtight system of forfeitures.
rationalize, crawled_triples/45.txt, interests, are rationalized by, adherence to test , I persist in the belief that the interests of Sykes and the State of Florida are best rationalized by adherence to this test, and by declining to react to inadvertent defaults through the creation of an "airtight system of forfeitures.
conformance, crawled_triples/45.txt, conformance, is with, policy choice , 8 But liberal post-trial federal review is the redress [433 U.S. 72, 107] � that Congress ultimately chose to allow and the consequences of a state procedural default should be evaluated in conformance with this policy choice
widen, crawled_triples/45.txt, correct, must, properly must read in light of Congress ' norm of widened access , But whether Fay was correct in penalizing a litigant solely for his intentional forfeitures properly must be read in light of Congress' desired norm of widened post-trial access to the federal courts
relaxation, crawled_triples/45.txt, State 's institutional interests, thereby justifying, relaxation of Zerbst standard , It may be, of course, that the State's countervailing institutional interests are more compelling in the case of eliciting a procedural default, thereby justifying a relaxation of the Zerbst standard
prong, crawled_triples/45.txt, Court 's test, prong of be, redundancy , It also suggests that the "prejudice" prong of the Court's new test may prove to be a redundancy
unintentional, crawled_triples/45.txt, unintentional default, stand in, way of vindication of rights bearing , If this trial is to be followed, it would be quite unthinkable that an unintentional procedural default should be allowed to stand in the way of vindication of constitutional rights bearing upon the guilt or innocence of a defendant
pierce, crawled_triples/45.txt, one, pierces surface justifications for, harsher rule posited , I remain convinced that when one pierces the surface justifications for a harsher rule posited by the Court, no standard stricter than Fay's deliberate-bypass test is realistically defensible
negligent, crawled_triples/45.txt, caution, forestalling, negligent conduct , It is senseless because unplanned and unintentional action of any kind generally is not subject to deterrence; and, to the extent that it is hoped that a threatened sanction addressed to the defense will induce greater care and caution on the part of trial lawyers, thereby forestalling negligent conduct or error, the potential loss of all valuable state remedies would be sufficient to this end
professionalism, crawled_triples/45.txt, proper functioning, places reliance on, professionalism , Hence, while I can well agree that the proper functioning of our system of criminal justice, both federal and state, necessarily places heavy reliance on the professionalism and judgment of trial attorneys, I cannot accept a system that ascribes the absolute forfeiture of an individual's constitutional claims to situations where his lawyer manifestly exercises no professional judgment at all - where carelessness, mistake, or ignorance is the explanation for a procedural default
regrettable, crawled_triples/45.txt, it, is regrettable Of, course , Of course, it is regrettable that certain errors that might have been cured earlier had trial counsel acted expeditiously must be corrected collaterally and belatedly
wistfully, crawled_triples/45.txt, I, can understand, Court wistfully wishing , I can understand the Court's wistfully wishing for the day when the trial was the sole, binding and final "event" of the adversarial process - although I hesitate to agree that in the eyes of the criminal defendant it has ever ceased being the "main" one, ante, at 90
interlocutory, crawled_triples/45.txt, interlocutory review, is in, generality of cases , The federal criminal system, to take one example, expressly disapproves of interlocutory review in the generality of cases even though such a policy would foster finality by permitting the authoritative resolution of all legal and constitutional issues prior to the convening of the "main event.
belated, crawled_triples/45.txt, it, Instead relies on, belated correction of error , Instead, it relies on the belated correction of error, through appeal and collateral review, to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of the criminal sanction
yardstick, crawled_triples/45.txt, bypass test, least yields, coherent yardstick , Perhaps the primary virtue of Fay is that the bypass test at least yields a coherent yardstick for federal district courts in rationalizing their power of collateral review
offering, crawled_triples/45.txt, offering, explanation for, his default , Left unresolved is whether a habeas petitioner like Sykes can adequately discharge this burden by [433 U.S. 72, 117] � offering the commonplace and truthful explanation for his default: attorney ignorance or error beyond the client's control
truthful, crawled_triples/45.txt, offering, commonplace and truthful explanation for, his default , Left unresolved is whether a habeas petitioner like Sykes can adequately discharge this burden by [433 U.S. 72, 117] � offering the commonplace and truthful explanation for his default: attorney ignorance or error beyond the client's control
harmlessness, crawled_triples/45.txt, Court, with, appraisal of harmlessness of admission of confession , I disagree with the Court's appraisal of the harmlessness of the admission of respondent's confession, but if this is what is meant by prejudice, respondent's constitutional contentions could be as quickly and easily disposed of in this regard by permitting federal courts to reach the merits of his complaint
neglect, crawled_triples/45.txt, neglect, errors of, lawyers with rigor , If the scope of habeas jurisdiction previously governed by Fay v. Noia is to be redefined so as to enforce the errors and neglect of lawyers with unnecessary and unjust rigor, the time may come when conscientious and fairminded federal and state courts, in adhering to the teaching of Johnson v. Zerbst, will have to reconsider whether they can continue to indulge the comfortable fiction that all lawyers are skilled or even competent craftsmen in representing the fundamental rights of their clients
advisedly, crawled_triples/45.txt, I, use term policies advisedly for, it , [ Footnote 2 ] I use the term "policies" advisedly, for it is important to recognize the area of my disagreement with the Court
premeditation, crawled_triples/45.txt, counsel, rebut, premeditation in murder trial , Terry v. Henderson, 462 F.2d 1125, 1129 (CA2 1972) (bypass found where counsel relied on confession to rebut premeditation in murder trial); and United States ex rel
bolster, crawled_triples/45.txt, defense, would, would bolstered , If the state trial court is persuaded that a constitutional breach has occurred, the remedies dictated by the Constitution would be imposed, the defense would be bolstered, and the prosecution accordingly weakened, perhaps precluded altogether
sandbag, crawled_triples/45.txt, He, could elect to, sandbag , (2) He could elect to "sandbag.
deceive, crawled_triples/45.txt, he, deceive, federal habeas court , Third, to carry out his scheme, he would now be compelled to deceive the federal habeas court and to convince the judge that he did not "deliberately bypass" the state procedures
substantiation, crawled_triples/45.txt, Court, apparently believes without, substantiation , The Court, without substantiation, apparently believes that a meaningful number of lawyers are induced into option 2 by Fay

superfluous, crawled_triples/57.txt, we, construe as, superfluous , By treating 24(14) as conferring federal jurisdiction of suits brought under the Act of 1871 in which the right asserted is inherently incapable of pecuniary valuation, we harmonize the two parallel provisions of the Judicial Code, construe neither as superfluous, and give to each a scope in conformity with its history and manifest purpose

surge, crawled_triples/58.txt, surge, overruling, contrived doctrine , I venture to predict that overruling this judicially contrived doctrine - or limiting its scope to egregious, bad-faith conduct - would inspire a surge of activity toward providing some kind of statutory remedy for persons injured by police mistakes or misconduct

purportedly, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, informs Ante, purportedly adhering , Although purportedly adhering to the principle that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments "require exclusion" of evidence seized in violation of their commands, ante, at 481, the Court informs us that there has merely been a "view" in our cases that "the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment . . . requires the granting of habeas corpus relief when a prisoner has been convicted in state court on the basis of evidence obtained in an illegal search or seizure . . . ." Ante, at 480-481
incontrovertible, crawled_triples/58.txt, direct confrontation, is with, incontrovertible facts , Understandably the Court must purport to cast its holding in constitutional terms, because that avoids a direct confrontation with the incontrovertible facts that the habeas statutes have heretofore always been construed to grant jurisdiction to entertain Fourth Amendment claims of both state and federal prisoners, that Fourth Amendment principles have been applied in decisions on the merits in numerous cases on collateral review of final convictions, and that Congress has legislatively accepted our interpretation of congressional intent as to [428 U.S. 465, 508] � the necessary scope and function of habeas relief
plethora, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, overruling, any of our plethora of precedents , Indeed, the Court reaches its result without explicitly overruling any of our plethora of precedents inconsistent with that result or even discussing principles of stare decisis
reinterpret, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, reinterprets, Mapp , However the Court reinterprets Mapp, and whatever the rationale now attributed to Mapp's holding or the purpose ascribed to the exclusionary rule, the prevailing constitutional rule is that unconstitutionally seized evidence cannot be admitted in the criminal trial of a person whose federal constitutional rights were violated by the search or seizure
derogation, crawled_triples/58.txt, right, is in, derogation of Federal Constitution , And the basis for reversing those convictions would of course have to be that the States, in rejecting respondents' Fourth Amendment claims, had deprived them of a right in derogation of the Federal Constitution
primacy, crawled_triples/58.txt, efficacious method, asserting, primacy , And as between this Court on certiorari, and federal district courts on habeas, it is for Congress to decide what the most efficacious method is for enforcing federal constitutional rights and asserting the primacy of federal law
unjustifiable, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, is making, unjustifiable assumption , 11 And to the extent the Court is making the unjustifiable assumption that our certiorari jurisdiction is adequate to correct "routine" condonation of Fourth Amendment violations by state courts, surely it follows a fortiori that our jurisdiction is adequate to redress the "egregious" situation in which the state courts did not even accord a fair hearing on the Fourth Amendment claim
constriction, crawled_triples/58.txt, today, for, constriction of habeas jurisdiction , The "exception" thus may appear to make the holding more palatable, but it merely highlights the lack of a "constitutional" rationale for today's constriction of habeas jurisdiction

bury, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, bury, its premises in footnotes , Much in the Court's opinion suggests that a construction of the habeas statutes to deny relief for non-"guilt-related" constitutional violations, based on this Court's vague notions of comity and federalism, see, e. g., ante, at 478 n. 11, is the actual premise for today's decision, and although the Court attempts to bury its underlying premises in footnotes, those premises mark this case as a harbinger of future eviscerations of the habeas statutes that plainly does violence to congressional power to frame the statutory contours of habeas jurisdiction
harbinger, crawled_triples/58.txt, premises, mark case as, harbinger of future eviscerations , Much in the Court's opinion suggests that a construction of the habeas statutes to deny relief for non-"guilt-related" constitutional violations, based on this Court's vague notions of comity and federalism, see, e. g., ante, at 478 n. 11, is the actual premise for today's decision, and although the Court attempts to bury its underlying premises in footnotes, those premises mark this case as a harbinger of future eviscerations of the habeas statutes that plainly does violence to congressional power to frame the statutory contours of habeas jurisdiction

ignoble, crawled_triples/58.txt, Government, should play, ignoble part , 17 "The history of American freedom [428 U.S. 465, 525] � is, in no small measure, the history of procedure," Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 414 (1945) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.), and as Mr. Justice Holmes so succinctly reminded us, it is "a less evil that some criminals should escape than that the Government should play an ignoble part.
casually, crawled_triples/58.txt, I t, is abuse, deal too casually , [I]t is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, even though they involve limitations upon State power and may be invoked by those morally unworthy.
abnegate, crawled_triples/58.txt, today 's decision, substantially abnegates, duty , Federal courts have the duty to carry out the congressionally [428 U.S. 465, 526] � assigned responsibility to shoulder the ultimate burden of adjudging whether detentions violate federal law, and today's decision substantially abnegates that duty
mistrust, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, of, mistrust , But to the extent federal law is erroneously applied by the state courts, there is no authority in this Court to deny defendants the right to have those errors rectified by way of federal habeas; 19 indeed, the Court's reluctance to accept Congress' desires along these lines can only be a manifestation of this Court's mistrust for federal judges
accentuate, crawled_triples/58.txt, Nebraska Supreme Court 's distortion, thereby accentuate, general potential for erroneous adjudication of Amendment claims , Of course, for the Court strongly to reiterate the fundamentality of this principle would only highlight the Nebraska Supreme Court's distortion of the Fourth Amendment in an emotionally charged case, and thereby accentuate the general potential for erroneous state-court adjudication of Fourth Amendment claims
offhand, crawled_triples/58.txt, their federal constitutional claims, is with, offhand remark , The Court, however, dismisses respondents' effective inability to have a single federal court pass on their federal constitutional claims with the offhand remark that "respondents were, of course, free to file a timely petition for certiorari prior to seeking federal habeas corpus relief.
bestow, crawled_triples/58.txt, it, is, grace seldom bestowed at behest of defendant , Of course, federal review by certiorari in this Court is a matter of grace, and it is grace now seldom bestowed at the behest of a criminal defendant
transparent, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, Employing, transparent tactic , Employing the transparent tactic that today's is a decision construing the Constitution, the Court usurps the authority - vested by the Constitution in the Congress - to reassign federal judicial responsibility for reviewing state prisoners' claims of failure of state courts to redress violations of their Fourth Amendment rights
unsuited, crawled_triples/58.txt, Our jurisdiction, is, eminently unsuited , Our jurisdiction is eminently unsuited for that task, and as a practical matter the only result of today's holding will be that denials by the state courts of claims by state prisoners of violations of their Fourth Amendment rights will go unreviewed by a federal tribunal
ominous, crawled_triples/58.txt, potential ramifications, are, ominous , I fear that the same treatment ultimately will be accorded state prisoners' claims of violations of other constitutional rights; thus the potential ramifications of this case for federal habeas jurisdiction generally are ominous
forthrightly, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, restrict forthrightly, constitutional rights of citizenry , The Court, no longer content just to restrict forthrightly the constitutional rights of the citizenry, has embarked on a campaign to water down even such constitutional rights as it purports to acknowledge [428 U.S. 465, 536] � by the device of foreclosing resort to the federal habeas remedy for their redress
inveterate, crawled_triples/58.txt, Court, Thus overrules, also inveterate line , Thus, the Court overrules not only a long line of cases concerning availability of habeas relief for state prisoners, but also a similarly inveterate line of cases concerning availability of counterpart 2255 relief for federal prisoners
functionally, crawled_triples/58.txt, Congress, has accorded, role in our scheme functionally equivalent to that , For to the extent Congress has accorded the federal district courts a role in our constitutional scheme functionally equivalent to that of the Supreme Court with respect to review of state-court resolutions of federal constitutional claims, it is evident that the Court's direct/collateral review distinction for constitutional purposes simply collapses
meritorious, crawled_triples/58.txt, individuals, is with, meritorious claims , The Court today, however, converts this doctrine dictating the timing of federal review into a doctrine precluding federal review, see Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 542 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); such action is in keeping with the regrettable recent trend of barring the federal courthouse door to individuals with meritorious claims
unsupportable, crawled_triples/58.txt, today 's decision, is, unsupportable , [ Footnote 11 ] In arguing in the Court's "deterrence" idiom, I emphasize that I am accepting the Court's assumptions concerning the purposes of the exclusionary rule only to demonstrate that, on its own premises, today's decision is unsupportable

unconscionable, crawled_triples/58.txt, official surveillance, acquisition through, unconscionable means , [ Footnote 13 ] Others might be claims of official surveillance of attorney-client communications, government acquisition of evidence through unconscionable means, see, e. g., Rochin v.

Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963), denial of the right to jury trial, see Ludwig v.

ostensible, crawled_triples/58.txt, none, suggested as, ostensible ratio decidendi , Three Justices dissented and would have held, as a statutory matter, that Fourth Amendment claims are not cognizable on federal habeas, but none suggested the "constitutional" thesis embraced by the Court as the ostensible ratio decidendi for today's cases

navigability, crawled_triples/59.txt, navigability, locality of, injury , 20 Not only is navigability itself a question of fact, as waters that are navigable in fact are navigable in law,21 but, where navigability is not in dispute, the locality of the injury, that is, whether it has occurred upon the navigable waters of the United States, determines the existence of the congressional power to create the liability prescribed by the statute
pivot, crawled_triples/59.txt, fact, is pivot of, statute , In the present instance, the Congress has imposed liability without fault only where the relation of master and servant exists in maritime employment, and, while we hold that the Congress could do this, the fact of that relation is the pivot of the statute, and, in the absence of any other justification, underlies the constitutionality of this enactment
superintendence, crawled_triples/59.txt, trials, are under, constant superintendence of trial judge , Even where issues of fact are tried by juries in the federal courts, such trials are under the constant superintendence of the trial judge
