Lee has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel's erroneous advice.	Applying the two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee could not show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.	Shift-in-View
The Government contends that Lee cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to acquittal.	Lee contends that he can make this showing because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation.	Shift-in-View
We instead consider whether the defendant was prejudiced by the "denial of the entire judicial proceeding . . . to which he had a right."	That is because, while we ordinarily "apply a strong presumption of reliability to judicial proceedings," "we cannot accord" any such presumption "to judicial proceedings that never took place."	Shift-in-View
Here Lee knew, correctly, that his prospects of acquittal at trial were grim, and his attorney's error had nothing to do with that.	That is true when the defendant's decision about going to trial turns on his prospects of success and those are affected by the attorney's error--for instance, where a defendant alleges that his lawyer should have but did not seek to suppress an improperly obtained confession.	Shift-in-View
Lee insists he would have gambled on trial, risking more jail time for whatever small chance there might be of an acquittal that would let him remain in the United States.2 The Government responds that, since Lee had no viable defense at trial, he would almost certainly have lost and found himself still subject to deportation, with a lengthier prison sentence to boot.	Lee, on the other hand, argues he can establish prejudice under Hill because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known that he would be deported as a result.	Shift-in-View
In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies almost exclusively on the single line from Hill that "the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."	The majority misapplies this Court's precedents when it concludes that a defendant may establish prejudice by showing only that "he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial," without showing that "the result of that trial would have been different than the result of the plea bargain."	Shift-in-View
The Court did not, however, further hold that a defendant can establish prejudice by making that showing alone.	In Hill, the Court concluded that the defendant had not made that showing, so it rejected his claim.	Shift-in-View
But that caveat says nothing about the application of the presumption of reliability when a defendant can make that threshold showing.	I agree that such an inquiry is not always necessary--it is not necessary where, as in Hill, the defendant cannot show at the threshold that he would have rejected his plea and chosen to go to trial.	Shift-in-View
But Tharpe never raised this argument in state court, so the state court did not err in failing to accept it.	In his reply brief in support of certiorari in this Court, Tharpe argues that he did not have to raise his claim of juror bias on direct appeal.	Shift-in-View
When he nonetheless challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government argued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second notice of appeal.	Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the amended judgment.	Shift-in-View
Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount imposed is unlawful.	Even if the District Court's acknowledgment in the initial judgment that restitution was mandatory could qualify as a "sentence" that the District Court "announced" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.	Shift-in-View
Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a "sentence" that the District Court "announced" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.	The court did not announce the restitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue) until months later.	Shift-in-View
Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed--an issue the court did not consider until months later--is unlawful.	Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a "sentence" that the District Court "announced" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.

The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined the plurality opinion, referred only to Albright's "arrest," 510 U. S., at 275 (concurring opinion); and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in the judgment, did so only because Albright's "allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment."	I agree that Albright's seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant (that would be ridiculous since he had not even been arrested at that point) or the first appearance, see ante, at 8-9, and n. 6, but it is impossible to read anything more into the holding in Albright.

In the end, Gerstein stands for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment requires a post-arrest probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate; it says nothing about whether the Fourth Amendment extends beyond that or any other "legal process."	This statement hardly shows that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein--which suggests that the Fourth Amendment might govern "only the first stage" of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our "elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct."	Shift-in-View
About two weeks later, on March 30, a grand jury indicted Manuel based on similar false evidence: testimony from one of the arresting officers that "[t]he pills field tested positive" for ecstasy.	Although not addressed in Manuel's complaint, the police department's alleged fabrications did not stop at this initial hearing on probable cause.	Shift-in-View
The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular investigation.	The judge instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause violation, it must find that he "corruptly" engaged in at least one of eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended corruptly to interfere with that investigation.	Shift-in-View
This Court cannot "lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply."	The Omnibus Clause does not use the word "proceeding" at all, but instead refers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more than that.	Shift-in-View
It is hard to see how the Court's statute is less vague than the one Congress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not to corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS' administration of the Tax Code.	"Reasonably foreseeable" is again defined negatively as "not . . . that the defendant knew the IRS may catch onto his unlawful scheme eventually."	Shift-in-View
There is reason to think that it could have.	It did not specifically consider whether access to the type of meaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense that Ake requires would have mattered.	Shift-in-View
And when the Sixth Circuit reviewed that decision en banc, its holding was fractured, but 7 of the 13 judges expressed the view that Ake requires only a neutral, court-appointed expert.3 919 F. 2d 1091, 1110, 1117-1120, 1131-1132 (1990).	A Sixth Circuit panel held that Ake does not require appointment of a defense-team expert.	Shift-in-View
But as far as the record shows, Dr. Goff was never asked and never refused to provide assistance to McWilliams.	Instead, the crux of the Court's complaint is that Dr. Goff merely submitted his report and did not provide further assistance to the defense.	Shift-in-View
The CCA also considered and recounted the testimony of the other experts who, unlike Dr. Compton, concluded that Moore had shown significant adaptive deficits.	Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore and review of documentary evidence--including school, trial, and prison records--did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.	Shift-in-View
Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways it might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas--conceptual, social, and practical--should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform a skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.	In support of this proposition, the Court cites the AAIDD's direction that "significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills."	Shift-in-View
The Exoneration Act provides a civil claim for relief "to compensate an innocent person who was wrongly convicted."	Due process therefore requires some mechanism "for the return of a defendant's money," Justice Hood maintained, 362 P. 3d, at 1080; as the Exoneration Act required petitioners to prove their innocence, the Act, he concluded, did not supply the remedy due process demands, id., at 1081.	Shift-in-View
But the Clause, properly understood, has nothing to say about the existence or scope of the substantive entitlement itself.	This Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to require that the States provide certain procedures, such as notice and a hearing, by which an individual can prove a substantive entitlement to (or defend against a deprivation of ) property.	Shift-in-View
No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required them to pay the money at issue.	Colorado is therefore not required to provide any process at all for the return of that money.	Shift-in-View
Wolfish held only that the presumption does not prevent the government from "detain[ing a defendant] to ensure his presence at trial . . . so long as [the] conditions and restrictions [of his detention] do not amount to punishment, or otherwise violate the Constitution."	Our opinion in that case recognized that "under the Due Process Clause," a detainee who "has not been adjudged guilty of any crime" may not be punished.	Shift-in-View
